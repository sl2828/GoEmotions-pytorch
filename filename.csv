Vaccine-HPV Questions about being sexually active while taking Gardasil doses,"I 19F have recently started dating a guy and have considered becoming sexually active with him. The thing is, he has been sexually active in the past while I am a virgin and I only recently received the first dose for Gardasil about a month ago. Should I take all sexual activity off the table until I have taken all three doses, or is there anything we can do while I am taking them?  I read that there is currently no way for guys to get tested for HPV. I am on birth control and do plan on using condoms and dental dams in the future, but if we do become sexually active would that be enough to protect myself from HPV? Ideally if things work out I would like to have sex sooner than later, but I also would like to be safe. What are the risks?","{'labels': ['curiosity'], 'scores': [0.9810354113578796]}"

"Girlfriend likely got HPV from me, now has early stage cervical cancer.","I met my girlfriend about half a year ago when I moved to a new city. While she's had a boyfriend before, they haven't had PIV sex before oral only from my understanding and she's basically a virgin. I've had a few girlfriends before and multiple FWB / random hookups. Admittedly, I've never been disciplined to use condoms every single time. However, I've always been through screenings for STDs and have never contracted anything. Since I've been with my girlfriend, we've used condoms for PIV sex and she's not on birth control due to personal reasons. Also, I don't think she's been vaccinated for HPV her family doesn't really follow through recommended childhood vaccinations. I've been vaccinated through the roof ever since I was a child.  Recently, my girlfriend was tested for a pap smear and it came back positive for HPV. She had a follow-up appointment and the doctor said something along the lines of her having 1 stage or early stage cervical cancer. They took biopsies to send to pathology and take a closer look. My girlfriend appeared very calm when telling me this over the phone and she said the doctor told her not to worry. However, when I met with her later that day, she was crying a lot. She insisted it wasn't because of the doctor visit, but I am pretty certain it was.  Also, perhaps this isn't directly related, she recently went on depression medication prior to pap smear. She was fairly depressed when I met her, and I insisted that she visit a counselor and psychiatrist. She's had frequent episodes of crying and wanted to quit work because of the stress, and I thought I really needed to push her to go to the doctor. Since being on the medication, she's been really happy and also applied to new jobs.   I feel like this whole situation is my fault - if I didn't sleep around or been more careful she might not have HPV / early stage cervical cancer. I was really confused why she had HPV, then I realized men can't even get screened for it. Despite using a condom, I'm certain I passed it on to her. And now she has early stage cervical cancer. I don't know what to do. Last night, she was crying and I think it's because she was around me. What can I do for her? I really love her and want to be with her, but now she has cancer because of me.","{'labels': ['caring', 'realization'], 'scores': [0.3397136926651001, 0.40959614515304565]}"

Should I get the HPV vaccine or is it too late?,"So a little backstory, I am not currently sexually active and my only sexual partner in the past was also a virgin at the time.  So I am not worried about having contracted HPV, but I want to know if the vaccine will still be worth me getting.  I am 20 years old, I was homeschooled in an extremely fundamentalist Christian home, and the only thing mother ever told me about sex was that if I had it outside of marriage I would definitely get an STD and get pregnant and my life would be over.  This has bothered me ever since because I have never wanted children and abortion has been under attack in my state for years.  I had just turned 13 when Gardasil first came out in the U.S. so I was part of the age they were targeting at the time.  My mother refused to have the health department give my sister and I the vaccine because she said that we could die or get sick from it because some other girls had gotten sick, though I feel it had more to do with believing that giving us the shot would cause us to want to have sex because we wouldn't have to be scared about getting HPV.  Reading about it later it seems like a lot of fundamentalists were against it for that reason, basically the same reason a lot of them are against giving condoms and birth control to teenagers instead of teaching abstinence.  I have read a lot about safe sex to make up for the lack of sexual education I got as a child and I have always only ever had protected sex, I just am unsure about protecting against HPV and if I should get the vaccine.  Looking into the vaccine after I became an adult and moved out it doesn't seem to actually be that dangerous.  Would it still be effective for me to get as a 20 or 21 year old or is it too late to be effective?

"Worse than nothing, how ineffective vaccines enhance disease","In the current debate over whether or not to legislate the removal of individual vaccine exemptions, the quality of the vaccines themselves gets little attention. According to the CDC, mumps outbreaks are on the rise despite the fact that 94.6 of children in the U.S. have had two doses of MMR vaccine. To combat the situation, the CDC is  considering adding a third dose of MMR to the recommended vaccine schedule  In 2010, California experienced the largest pertussis epidemic since 1958. According to the CDC, the U.S. has experienced increased pertussis disease despite high levels of vaccine coverage. Researchers studying the pertussis outbreaks determined vaccine effectiveness dropped to less than 9 by four years, and that the quality of immunization waned so rapidly that little protection remained 2-3 years after vaccination.  Influenza vaccination has had no beneficial effect on flu mortality. The CDC indicates vaccine effectiveness has oscillated between 10-60 from 2005-2017,  while systematic reviews show little to no benefit of inactivated influenza vaccines on flu morbidity.  Its clear that some vaccines dont work as well as advertised. And yet, instead of first making a vaccine with better effectiveness, the solution is to use the force of law to make everyone get more shots of the failing vaccine.  Even when significant vaccine failure rates for vaccines are  acknowledged, the legislative solution remains fully supported. Concerns over the need for more effective vaccines are dismissed by apologetics pointing out that the current vaccines are better than nothing.  The assumption is implicit low immunity is better than no immunity.  So, until a better vaccine comes along, accept the current shot at whatever level of immunity it provides.  But the notion that any amount of antibodies is preferable to no antibodies at all, is dangerously wrong. The same exact antibodies that prevent disease at higher concentrations, can enhance the disease at lower concentrations.  Instead of preventing infection, the antibodies permit a more invasive spread of the virus into different cell types, enhancing the disease and making it worse than if the child had never been vaccinated.  This phenomenon is called antibody-dependent enhancement of disease, and it is a potential problem for vaccines that induce low levels of antibodies.  Its not just a theoretical concern. It has happened. Vaccine-induced  disease enhancement occurred previously with a measles vaccine that produced low levels of immunity.   From Iankov et al. 2006     An unexpectedly severe form of measles atypical measles was observed in immunized persons in the mid-1960s  Three doses of measles vaccine induced a short-lasting humoral immune response, followed several months or years later by susceptibility to atypical measles  Antibodies recognizing measles virus can increase the efficiency of virus entry into cells of the monocytic lineage  Antibody-mediated enhancement of infection may also contribute to  cytokine alteration and modulation of the innate immune mechanisms  during measles  The results point to an additional pathogenic mechanism that may be  in play during measles virus infections and which may have particular  relevance to the pathogenesis of the atypical measles that is seen after  immunization.  The effect of vaccine-induced disease enhancement has been seen in clinical trials for a since abandoned HIV vaccine.   From Huisman et al. 2009     Certain experimental vaccines have proved to be counterproductive  they rendered vaccinated subjects more susceptible to infection rather  than protecting them  For candidate HIV vaccines a number of phase III trials have been  conducted in seronegative volunteers at high risk for HIV infection  The outcome of these trials was far from encouraging, with very  limited induction of HIV neutralizing antibodies, and no evidence for  protection  In one clinical trial, a significant trend towards increased HIV-1 infection was observed  Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection remains a significant concern in the development of safe and effective vaccines  There may well be a delicate balance between the induction of  protective immunity on the one hand and the induction of enhanced  susceptibility on the other.  The HPV vaccine exhibited the capacity to enhance HPV infections during clinical trials. Women who tested positive for vaccine HPV serotypes by PCR analysis, and were then administered the vaccine, were more likely to  develop high-grade cervical lesions than the non-vaccinated control group. These observations have persisted beyond clinical trials, and  antibody-dependent enhancement has been raised as a possible  explanation.   From Manos 2009     Vaccination of women with previous HPV 16 or 18 infection might actually increase their risk of high-grade cervical disease  This observation is strikingly consistent with reports on the quadrivalent HPV vaccine  Although each trials finding was attributed to imbalances in the  baseline characteristics of the vaccine and placebo groups, the  biological phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease  should be considered  Perhaps HPV testing should precede vaccination and be contraindicated for women and girls previously infected.  Its been known for decades that non-neutralizing influenza  antibodies can augment the uptake of influenza A virus strains, but it  wasnt until recently that the phenomenon of disease enhancement for  influenza vaccination was observationally proven.  In 2009, seasonal influenza vaccination increased the risk of  pandemic influenza illness in those who received the vaccine. This  result was confirmed in four observational studies.  Antibody-dependent  enhancement of disease has been proposed as the potentiating mechanism.  Vaccines sometimes do nothing  they cause no harm as they fail to protect the vaccine recipient from disease.  Sometimes vaccines do worse than nothing  they cause more cases, and more severe cases of disease in those who opt to be vaccinated.  Low levels of antibodies cannot be viewed as less of a  good thing. Ineffective vaccines are a bad thing. They stimulate low  level immune responses that sometimes potentiate the exact diseases they  were intended to prevent.  Legislation that would force the use of an ineffective vaccine must be abandoned.  But thats not enough. The ineffective product itself must be abandoned.  According to the FDA, vaccine policy that mandates usage of an  ineffective vaccine leads to disease outbreaks in older age groups that  are more likely to suffer complications from disease.  Vaccine policy aimed at preventing outbreaks and eradicating disease  can only succeed when there is high vaccine uptake of an effective  vaccine. If one is missing, there is no point in having the other.  New vaccines are required. The continued use of some of the current,  poorly-performing vaccines, moots any perceived necessity to legislate  forced uptake, because no amount of vaccine uptake will prevent disease  outbreaks.  Even with 100 compliance, outbreaks would still occur because the  vaccines are not effective enough to provide population level immunity  sufficient to prevent epidemics.  Furthermore, outbreaks will continue to occur in older age groups  where complications from disease are more common, and mothers will have  little to no immunity to provide to their newborns during those early  critical months of life.  Individuals should have the legal right to exempt themselves and  their children from using the current products. For practical and  ethical reasons, the conversation to mandate the use of vaccines  shouldnt even be considered until more effective products are  available.

Finally he met with Dr. Howard Haft, deputy director of the Maryland Department of Health who said it was CDC, yet CDCs policy is to not take positions on state-specific legislation.  Suspecting that there was something else going on behind the scenes, in April 2018 he filed a Public Information Act request with the Prevention and Health Promotion Administration only to discover that the Maryland health department had received 91.6 million pharma funded non-profits to promote the HPV vaccine in Maryland.    Keep in mind that Big Pharma can skip taxes by saying they are donating to non profits / 'charities' which they control, as we see they are then using this 'washed' the money which should have been paid in taxes to lobby/bribe government officials, who in return reward them by setting up unscientific pushes for dangerous Big Pharma products.  These non profits / 'charities' are also used to misinform the media about whatever the latest 'health crisis' is and why the latest dangerous Big Pharma products are 'essential' to save the day.  Josh wanted to find out more about the supposed HPV 'health crisis', so he met with Dr. Pete Doshi, assistant professor of pharmaceutical health services research at the University of Maryland.  Dr Doshi said he was unaware of any HPV 'health crisis' and explained that 98 percent of HPVs clear the body naturally within a few years.  It was also confirmed that Marylands rates of cervical cancer were in decline for years prior to introduction of the vaccine the vaccine itself has never been proven to prevent cancer.  It was noted that HPVs are sexually transmitted, an important fact not disclosed in the health department letter.  Josh warns ""The approach being used by our state to prevent HPV cancer seems to be centered on fear mongering the dangers of the disease and over selling the potential benefits of the vaccine. The entire effort seems to be more a sales campaign than a disease prevention program."" He then points out that the vaccine itself has been proven to have the capacity to kill healthy individuals ""The harm that may arise is tragically illustrated by the death in 2008 of Sparks resident Christina Tarsell after her third HPV shot. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision September of 2017 states the preponderance of evidence demonstrates the shot series caused the fatal arrhythmia that took Christinas life.""  So in short-    1. Big Pharma skip their taxes donating to lobbyists disguised as charities, thereby washing the money 2. The lobbyists bribe government health officials 3. In return unscientific and dangerous products gets mandated by government 4. People are made sick from the mandated products, meaning they buy more Big Pharma drugs to treat their symptoms 5.

"After a study found that females who received the controversial HPV vaccine were less likely to give birth, it has now been confirmed that populations with higher HPV vaccine uptake have seen a greater decrease in fertility than the so-called 'vaccine hesitant' communities","Birth rates have been dropping ever since the introduction of the HPV vaccine, the mainstream media claimed it was down to improved sex education.   However, in June 2018 a study was published which had discovered that if one compares the girls who received the HPV vaccine with those who haven't, the vaccinated were less likely to go on to give birth.  TPTB and Big Pharma instantly said it was just a coincidence, while the skeptics saw it as confirmation of what they suspected all along that the HPV vaccine was in fact a fertility-reduction program in disguise as vaccination, similar to the ones which have been carried out in Africa  Now further evidence has been released in a new report which found that the fertility has declined more in urban areas, and less so in rural ones.  In 2017 it was reported that rural areas are not as willing to accept the HPV vaccination as urban ones, from the article the vaccination rate against human papillomavirus, or HPV, was 16 percentage points lower in rural areas than urban areas.  We also see that the average age of new moms is rising this again fits in with the HPV vaccine causation theory as the vaccine has been going around high schools since late 2007, older women will have missed it unless they made a special effort.","{'labels': ['neutral'], 'scores': [0.9978141784667969]}"

Reminder Get Vaccinated for HPV if You Haven't Yet,"This might be a bit off topic, but I'd just like to remind everyone who hasn't gone through with getting, yourself or your children, vaccinated for HPV to get that done at the soonest possible opportunity, and because HPV is sexually transmitted, and one of the most common STIs, I figured this is a right place to post this.  The motivation for making this post and the reason I remembered is that my best friend recently got diagnosed with cervical cancer. I don't have the info about whether it was definitely caused by a strain of HPV that the vaccine prevents against or something else, but HPV is heavily linked to cervical cancer as well as other cancers penile, anal, throat... etc. The good news is they caught it very early, and it is operable, but needless to say is still worrying and sucks. So in addition to getting vaccinated, make sure you keep up to date on getting checked out.  Now I'm going to take a minute and rebut some of the more common reasons for not getting vaxxed   ""A licensed physician has told me I have a medical condition that makes me unable to safely receive a vaccine""- You're good. Lets hope enough people heed the warning for herd immunity to protect you.   ""I'm/my child is a male. The HPV vaccine isn't advertised as much to me, and I cannot get cervical cancer""- Well first off, cervical isn't the only form of cancer related to HPV, men can get other forms of cancer from an infection. Second, HPV can be carried asymptomatically, and to my knowledge no reliable test exists to diagnose men who don't show symptoms. You could be a carrier and not know, so it is best to protect yourself and by extension any partners from contracting and spreading the disease.   ""I'm/my child isn't sexually active at the moment""- Protect your future self.   ""The vaccine does not protect against all strains of the disease""- True but it is better to be protected from some strains rather than none.   ""I do not want to encourage my child to become sexually active too young""- Your child will do what they want, and will find a way to be sexually active even if you try to prevent it it is best to protect them in that case, or for in the future when even you think they're ready. They are also likely smart enough to know that getting a shot to protect against a potential illness is not a free pass from you to sleep around.   ""the vaccine isn't 100 effective so there is no point in getting it""- Some protection is better than none, few if any medical treatments are 100 effective, but they're better than nothing.   ""Vaccines don't prevent illness they cause it""- That statement is absolutely and demonstrably false.  edit Many people responding have stated that on this particular vaccines the risks outweigh the rewards, but as of yet none have provided specifics or documented evidence. I am not completely closed minded on this issue, but please cite a reputable source if you would like to ""educate"" me. Otherwise it is safe to assume you're talking out of your ass     ""my naturopath says...""- unless that is followed by ""I'm not qualified to educate you on vaccines go to a real doctor"" just go get the vaccine.  I hope this reminded at least a few of you to get the shots, or to schedule your kids, if you haven't already. Sorry for that bit of condescension towards anti-vaxxers at the end, but my patience is wearing thin with them I can edit that part out if the mods deem it necessary.   Edited to add if you are still on the fence, wondering if it's too late for you, or hesitant for any other reason. Please discuss this with your physician I am not qualified to give that level of medical advice, and am currently going with what I understand to be the current medical consensus. Even if you dont just go out and get the shot, please at least discuss it with your physician.  If anyone has evidence that my understanding of the consensus is flawed, I'd be happy to review that evidence, but since at this point you're making the extraordinary claim, the burden of proof is on you.","{'labels': ['optimism', 'neutral'], 'scores': [0.9420063495635986, 0.48595669865608215]}"
Herbs And Health 13-Year-Boy Is Paralyzed From The Neck Down After Gardasil HPV Vaccine - Herbs And Health,,"{'labels': ['neutral'], 'scores': [0.9768198132514954]}"
FDA just approved the HPV vaccine Gardasil 9 for women and men up to age 45 previously age 26!,"  So I just found out today that the FDA recently approved the HPV vaccine Gardasil 9 for use in both women and men up to age 45 previously it was approved only up to age 26 based on a new study which followed 3,200 women aged 27 through 45 years for an average of 3.5 years and showed that Gardasil was 88 effective in preventing infections, genital warts, precancerous lesions and cervical cancer more detailed info on that in the link above.  I have heard from, read about and talked to many other people who were over 26 and wished they could get the HPV vaccine, so this is very exciting! Make sure you talk to your health insurance first though to see whether or not they cover it. If they don't and you are willing to pay for it yourself, you can expect to pay at least 200 per shot, and you need a total of three shots first shot, second shot 2 months later, third shot 4 months after that which means 6 months after the first shot.  Keep in mind that the vaccine won't help or cure a certain type of HPV if a person already has it, however most people will most likely still benefit from this vaccine, as it is highly unlikely that somebody has already contracted all the HPV types that this vaccine can protect us from.   Here is some more information on the vaccine  In women, Gardasil 9 is indicated for the prevention of cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancer caused by HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58, and genital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11, as well as certain precancerous lesions caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58.  In men, Gardasil is indicated for the prevention of anal cancer caused by HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58, and genital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11, as well as certain precancerous lesions caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58  Source    For me personally, this news is huge, as just six months ago I asked and pleaded with my doctor to please give me a prescription for the vaccine despite my age. I am 31F, and I did not receive the vaccine as a teen, but I only ever had one partner, and we were both virgins when we got together, so I figured I didn't need it anyways. However, after my husband and I got into swinging, I changed my mind and it was so hard not to mention awkward especially when you're married to get that damn prescription! I am elated that my husband can get the vaccine now as well without all that hassle!  Edit I was asked to add the following info. If you are under 45  years old, you do not need a prescription anymore now that it's been approved for up to age 45. A pharmacist can just do it, no prescription needed. If you are older than that, you still need one though.","{'labels': ['neutral'], 'scores': [0.9726387858390808]}"

Should I wait for HPV vaccine?,"Hi! First things first, Im a 16 year old male, and my question is the title Should I wait for the HPV vaccine? I just moved and got a new doctor, and in my first examination he naturally sent my parents out of the room to talk to me. Other than the usual, do you do drugs, it was pretty standard except he stressed to me to wait until I get my HPV shot to become sexually active Im not and I told him I wasnt. Like really stressed this to me.The only problem is I dont really know what he means by sexually active. Vaginal sex? Oral? Other stuff? Naturally I did some googling and Im seeing all sorts of stuff that says 78 million Americans have HPV and that it can be spread even through hand-to-genital contact. I guess first of all, are these media sites even truthful? But assuming they are, could my girlfriend or I even have HPV to give to the other? We are both virgins, and I know that the most either of us have done with another person is kissing. I dont know if shes had the vaccine or not, but Im open to asking if the scenario is that if shes had it were good.

I got HPV from my very first partner at 16. Im now 26. Life goes on.,"I see a lot of posts about people worried about HPV and as someone whos been through it I just thought Id share my story. This is actually kind of therapeutic for me too.  When I was 16 I had my first boyfriend ever. He was 23 years old. We met online when I was 14 and a couple years later met in person. I wont go over the details of the relationship because its really sickening and messed up in its own way. But long story short, he was the first person I ever did anything more than kissing with. I had never even given a hand job or dry humped over clothes before. We had sex within a week of meeting and after about 2 months of regular sex I noticed a strange off-white growth on my anus. I honestly just convinced myself it was a hemorrhoid for a while. I remember trying to sneakily look at my boyfriends penis while performing oral sex to see if he had any bumps thats how immature I was. I couldnt even ask to get a good look at this part of his body that I was putting in my mouth. Then a short while after the first wart I noticed two little brown mole-looking growths, one on my labia and another just above it. Thats when I really started to worry. I went to my doctor and had my very first pap-smear. She told me right away that the bumps were genital warts caused by HPV. My pap, of course, came back abnormal however it was considered low-grade not a risk for cervical cancer, thankfully. She made another appointment to have the warts burned off. It was painful and the healing process was not fun at all. But at least the warts were gone.  I can remember feeling like my life..was over. I was 16, had only been sexual with ONE person who claimed to be clean, there is no cure, how was I ever supposed to be with anyone else? How could I trust anyone to be honest about their sexual health? And what about the people who truly dont know they have it and pass it on? This diagnoses honestly mortified me for years. I had abnormal paps every year after that for a long time and the wart on my anus came back one time 4 years later, which I had burned off again. I will always have scars on my vagina from the other two. I didnt have another boyfriend until I was 20. But you know what? Life does go on. You get older and realize that HPV is absurdly common. And if you get warts you honestly are getting one of the safer strains, as bad as that sounds. I started living a healthier lifestyle, improved my immune system and the warts have stayed away for over 6 years now. Ive had protected and unprotected sex since my diagnoses and my partners have been unaffected. I got pregnant, gave birth, and my baby is completely unharmed. Your body will heal. The virus will clear. Side note You should always inform any sexual partners of your STD if youre aware you have it. This can be a difficult conversation and not everyone will be okay with it, but with the statistics for HPV being so high, youll probably be surprised by how common it really is.  So I just want to say to anyone who might be struggling psychologically, please stop torturing yourself. At 16, mortified and too ashamed to tell anyone, I definitely couldve used some advice and guidance rather than the horror stories I googled. Just try to live as healthy as a lifestyle as you can and improve your immune system - this is the very best way to clear the virus on your own. Girls - GET YOUR PAPS! Even if you have no symptoms - the silent strains can cause cancer if left untreated so early prevention is important. Also, I still need to receive the Gardasil vaccines, been putting it off for too long but I do recommend it as well. Although it does not cure HPV already contracted or protect you from ALL strains, it does protect you from the most common ones.   But most importantly please be kind to yourself and your body and learn to forgive. Thank you for reading ","{'labels': ['realization'], 'scores': [0.6652031540870667]}"
Information for LGBT people about HPV,"Please vaccinate yourself with Gardasil or Gardasil 9 as soon as possible   Human papillomavirus HPV prevalence varies by population. This study investigated anal HPV type detection risk by country in a population of men who have sex with men MSM and transgender women TW at risk of HIV. Sexually active HIV-1-uninfected MSM and TW were enrolled at eight sites four in the United States US, two in Thailand, one in Peru, and one in South Africa. Baseline anal HPV swabs were collected, and DNA typing was performed. One hundred and ninety-five participants, 76 42 from the US, had a mean age of 30.9 years range 1864. In 182 participants with results available, anal HPV infection was common with 169 93 with 1 type, 132 73 with 1 nine-valent vaccine types, and 66 36 with HPV 16. Participants in the US had a higher prevalence of HPV 16 56, p  0.004 and HPV 6 69, p  0.001 compared to the other regions. Stimulant drug use was significantly associated with HPV 6 detection. Anal HPV is highly prevalent in this population of MSM and TW sampled from four countries, with HPV 16 the most commonly detected type. The nine-valent HPV vaccine has the potential to provide significant protection if given prior to exposure.    Vaccinate yourself even if you had previous HPV infections   Because of the high risk of reinfection, vaccinating boys who have not yet been exposed may be crucial to reduce prevalence, but our results suggest that there may also be large benefits to vaccinating previously infected individuals.

Having sex inbetween HPV Vaccine shots,"Hi, so I'm a 25 year old man thinking of taking the HPV vaccine as I heard certain strains can cause throat and penile cancer. It'll require 3 separate shots before it's complete. 2nd one after a month, 3rd one after 3 months   However, I was wondering if anyone knows if I can have sex before I've completed all 3 shots ie. after the first shot or second shot. Does the first shot protect you for some period of time? Or do you need all 3 before your body produces the antibodies to protect against HPV.  I know for a fact that I do not have any strain of HPV now so if I'm going to pay a large sum of money to get the shots, I would like to make sure I get the full protection and not waste it by having sex and catching some strain of HPV before I'm protected.

"Girl dies after receiving HPV Vaccine - Brain found to be injured, inflamed and nerve tissues full of aluminum"," Some of the cellular stains described above show apparent abnormalities. These include      1. A number of cells undergoing programmed cell death in the hippocampus and cerebellum    2. Neuro inflammation, particularly in the hippocampus    3. The presence of stress markers in cerebellum and hippocampus.    4. The presence of aluminium labelling in all areas.          The first three outcomes point to some form of brain injury and could be taken to support the types of clinical symptoms that Jasmine experienced. However, given that we have only Jasmine's samples and no controls, we can't be sure that the condition is not part of a ""normal"" spectrum across a population of women of her age group. While I believe this to be unlikely, it might be difficult to prove otherwise.          The aluminum in the various brain regions is telling and could only have come from an outside source. That source could be by diet we all consume a certain amount of aluminum daily in our normal diet, antacids, antiperspirants, or vaccines with aluminum adjuvants. Gardasil does contain aluminum, but so do many other vaccines, so it is difficult to pinpoint Gardasil as the reason for the aluminum in the brain.    Given that people dont get symptoms like this, just from food aluminium like baking powder, or antiperspirant  and given that Jasmine didnt take anti-acids, and only had one vaccine containing aluminium, the family consider the vaccine to be the source of aluminium.

"Japan Leads the Way in Child Health No Compulsory Vaccines. Banned Measles Mumps Rubella MMR Vaccine, No HPV"," The Promise of Good Health Are We Jumping Off the Cliff in the U.S.?    Childrens Health Defense, posted on Global Research on April 28, 2019     In the United States, many legislators and public health officials are busy trying to make vaccines de facto compulsoryeither by removing parental/personal choice given by existing vaccine exemptions or by imposing undue quarantines and fines on those who do  not comply with the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions CDCs  vaccine edicts. Officials in California are seeking to override medical opinion about fitness for vaccination, while those in New York are mandating the measles-mumps-rubella MMR vaccine for 6-12-month-old infants for whom its safety and effectiveness have not been established   The  U.S. has the very highest infant mortality rate of all industrialized developed countries, with more American children dying at birth and in their first year than in any other comparable nationand more than half of those who survive develop at least one chronic illness.   American  children would be better served if these officialsbefore imposing questionable and draconian measuresstudied child health outcomes in Japan.   With a population of 127 million, Japan has the healthiest children and the very highest healthy life expectancy in the world the least vaccinated children of any developed country. The U.S., in  contrast, has the developed worlds most aggressive vaccination schedule in number and timing, starting at pregnancy, at birth and in the first two years of life. Does this make U.S. children healthier? The clear answer is no.   The U.S. has the very highest infant mortality rate of all  industrialized countries, with more American children dying at birth and in their first year than in any other comparable nationand more than half of those who survive develop at least one chronic illness. Analysis of  real-world infant mortality and health results shows that U.S. vaccine  policy does not add up to a win for American children.   Japan and the U.S. Two Different Vaccine Policies   In 1994, Japan transitioned away from mandated vaccination in public  health centers to voluntary vaccination in doctors offices, guided by  the concept that it is better that vaccinations are performed by childrens family doctors who are familiar with their health conditions The country created two categories of non-compulsory vaccines routine vaccines that the government covers and strongly recommends but does not mandate, and additional voluntary vaccines, generally paid for out-of-pocket. Unlike in the U.S., Japan has no vaccine requirements for children entering preschool or elementary school.   Japan also banned the MMR vaccine in the same time frame, due to thousands of serious injuries over a four-year periodproducing an injury rate of one in 900 children that was over 2,000 times higher than the expected rate. It initially offered separate measles and rubella vaccines following its abandonment  of the MMR vaccine Japan now recommends a combined measles-rubella MR  vaccine for routine use but still shuns the MMR. The mumps vaccine is in the voluntary category. Here are key differences between the Japanese and U.S. vaccine programs     Japan has no vaccine mandates, instead recommending vaccines that as discussed above are either routine covered by insurance or voluntary self-pay.  Japan does not vaccinate newborns with the hepatitis B HepB vaccine, unless the mother is hepatitis B positive.  Japan does not vaccinate pregnant mothers with the tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis Tdap vaccine.  Japan does not give flu shots to pregnant mothers or to six-month-old infants.  Japan does not give the MMR vaccine, instead recommending an MR vaccine.  Japan does not require the human papillomavirus HPV vaccine.  In contrast, the U.S. vaccine schedule see Table 1    Prescribes routine vaccination during pregnancy,   Calls for the first HepB vaccine dose within 24 hours of birtheven though 99.9 of pregnant women, upon testing, are hepatitis B negative, and   Follows up with 20 to 22 vaccine doses in the first year alone.   No other developed country administers as many vaccine doses in the first two years of life. The HepB vaccine injects a newborn with a 250-microgram load of aluminum, a neurotoxic and immune-toxic adjuvant used to provoke an immune  response. There are no studies to back up the safety of exposing infants to such high levels of the injected metal.","{'labels': ['neutral'], 'scores': [0.9963845014572144]}"

"Has anyone ""updated"" their HPV vaccines?","I'm a man in his mid 20's who received either the 2-valent or 4-valent version of the HPV vaccine at some point over 10 years ago. The earlier 2-valent vaccine protects against the two most carcinogenic strains of HPV, while the 4-valent vaccine additionally protects against two strains that cause non-cancerous warts. These days there is a 9-valent vaccine that additionally protects against 5 more somewhat carcinogenic strains.  HPV has high transmission rates, spreads easily because it is often without symptoms, and causes a high percentage of cancers affecting the genitals and throat. The cancer risk is higher in women but still scarily high in men, plus I care about my future partners. I tend to have short-term partners and don't plan on settling down monogomously soon.  The recommendation of major health organizations and insurers is to not give the 9-valent vaccine to persons who already received one of the earlier vaccines in particular, the vaccine is not covered by my insurance and would cost me 600 out of pocket. Still, I'm in a stable financial such that this feels possibly worth it to me.   wondering whether any redditors have had similar experiences with a decision like this.

Abstaining from any intimacy during HPV Vaccination series,"I'm a guy in my mid-20's who somehow managed to never have sex or so much as kiss a girl. It's something I'm going to work towards changing as soon as possible, but before that, I wanted to vaccinate myself against HPV.  The HPV vaccine for my age range is a 3-shot series taken over the course of 6 months. I just took the first dose so it's going to be a long wait.  I already plan to avoid sex of any kind until the 3 shots are complete. However, some studies showed that ""deep kissing"" kissing with tongue involved can transmit HPV. Since something like 90 of sexually active adults have HPV, should I also abstain from kissing anyone until the vaccination series is complete?  It sounds kind of insane so that's why I wanted to ask for some opinions. The chance of transmitting HPV from kissing is probably a lot lower than from sex, but if I'm going through the effort of vaccinating myself, why not just wait another few months?   At the same time, this will mean I probably can't get into any sort of relationship  with a girl for the next few months if I can't even so much as kiss them.","{'labels': ['curiosity'], 'scores': [0.4541678726673126]}"

Let's talk about Polysorbate 80,"First off, I'm a layman not a scientist - so I feel like I'm probably missing something about polysorbate 80 that I'm hopeful this subreddit can assist with.  My understanding is that it is a relatively benign substance made by mixing oil and water together into a stable, uniform state and used as an emulsifier in both food production and beauty products to help with consistency.  It is also used as an ingredient in many vaccines as an excipient and emulsifier.  That's all well and good.  It's just basically oil and water, right?  Well, I had a discussion with an anti-vaxxer who stated that polysorbate 80 was used in chemotherapy as a means of getting the active ingredient past the blood brain barrier.  I looked into that claim and found it substantiated.  I then looked for information addressing why the anti-vaxxer's argument was invalid on both Reddit and Google and frankly didn't find much satisfaction.  The only people I found addressing these claims were a couple Reddit posts, a WordPress blog, and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's website with this explanation that seemed to be the authoritative source on the topic since their statement is repeated on the majority of the Google results as fact  ""The HPV vaccine contains polysorbate 80 as a stabilizer. Some stories on the internet have suggested that polysorbate 80 in this vaccine causes infertility. First, it is important to know that the HPV vaccine does not cause infertility. Second, polysorbate 80 has been used for many years as an emulsifier to make ice cream smooth and to slow melting. A typical serving of ice cream 1/2 cup may contain about 170,000 micrograms of polysorbate 80. On the other hand, the amount of polysorbate 80 in each dose of the HPV vaccine  50 micrograms  is very small. Therefore, polysorbate 80 isnt contained in vaccines at quantities that could possibly do harm.""  I found the statement lacking in credibility as ingesting a substance is not the same thing as injecting it straight into your bloodstream.  It seemed like a comparison of apples and oranges.  The other argument I found was that the amount used in chemotherapy was orders of magnitude more and that at lower volumes it doesn't have the same effect.  I didn't feel competent to evaluate that claim myself but it seemed reasonable.  However, polysorbate 80 isn't just used in chemotherapy and vaccines it's also used as a surfactant coating for drugs that need to get the active ingredient through to the brain.  Since I already had the volumes used in vaccine shots from the Children's Hospital statement, I looked for studies outlining how much polysorbate 80 is needed to noticeably raise drug efficacy when targeting the brain.  I didn't end up with an exact microgram amount but the impression I got after reading various abstracts and studies was coating drugs in a polysorbate 80 layer is one of the most effective and promising methods when developing medications that need to reach the brain.  Additionally, at least one of the papers comparing concentration levels of Tween 80 another name for polysorbate 80 appeared to indicate the effect of the surfactant is basically linear in it's effectiveness at getting drugs past the blood brain barrier.  So I'm requesting some assistance in putting these worries to rest.  Does the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia have it right and I simply can't parse the studies due to my layman grasp on science?  Or is there legitimate cause to be concerned based on the science?  Please note  I'm already convinced that by itself polysorbate 80 is non-toxic and mostly benign there's no need to focus on that area.  I'm mostly concerned about the effects the ingredient has on getting other, potentially harmful, ingredients to the brain when they would otherwise be kept out by the blood brain barrier.  Sorry for the length and if you stuck with me through that, you have my thanks.  Edit Fixed milligram to microgram.","{'labels': ['neutral'], 'scores': [0.9909982681274414]}"

Merck has been accused of committing fraud in its Gardasil vaccine safety trials putting millions of young girls at risk for ovarian failure or even death.,"   Gardasil is said to protect against cervical cancer, a disease that in the U.S., has a relatively low mortality rate of 1 in 43,478 2.3 per 100,000   In The  Plaintiffs Science Day Presentation on Gardasil, Robert F. Kennedy,  Jr. reveals Merck data showing Gardasil increases the overall risk of death by 370, risk of autoimmune disease by 2.3 and risk of a serious medical condition by 50    Postmarketing and adverse events reported during use of the vaccine post-licensing are listed on the Gardasil vaccine insert and include blood and lymphatic system disorders, pulmonary embolus, pancreatitis, autoimmune diseases, anaphylactic reactions, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, nervous system disorders and more   Mercks use of a neurotoxic aluminum adjuvant instead of a proper placebo in its safety trials effectively renders its safety testing null and void, as the true  extent of harm cannot be accurately ascertained      The HPV vaccine Gardasil was granted European license in February 2006,1 followed by U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA approval that same year in June.2  Gardasil was controversial in the U.S. from the beginning, with vaccine  safety activists questioning the quality of the clinical trials used to  fast track the vaccine to licensure.3  Lauded as a silver bullet against cervical cancer, there have been multiple continuing reports since it was licensed that Gardasil vaccine  has wrought havoc on the lives of young girls and young boys in the  U.S. and in countries across the world. Serious adverse reactions  reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS in  relation to Gardasil include but are not limited to4      Anaphylaxis  Guillain-Barre Syndrome  Transverse myelitis inflammation of the spinal cord  Pancreatitis  Venous thromboembolic events blood clots  Autoimmune initiated motor neuron disease a neurodegenerative disease that causes rapidly progressive muscle weakness  Multiple sclerosis  Sudden death     Postmarketing experiences and adverse events reported during post-approval use listed on the Gardasil vaccine insert5  include blood and lymphatic system disorders such as autoimmune  hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and  lymphadenopathy pulmonary embolus pancreatitis autoimmune diseases  anaphylactic reactions arthralgia and myalgia musculoskeletal and  connective tissue disorders nervous system disorders such as acute  disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, motor neuron  disease, paralysis, seizures and transverse myelitis and deep venous  thrombosis, a vascular disorder.  According to ""Manufactured Crisis  HPV, Hype and Horror,"" a film6  by The Alliance for Natural Health, there have also been cases of  16-year-old girls developing ovarian dysfunction, meaning they're going  into menopause, which in turn means they will not be able to have  children.  Despite such serious effects, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention CDC and FDA allege the vast majority, or even all, of  these tragic cases are unrelated to the vaccine, and that Gardasil is  safe.  The Plaintiff's Science Day Presentation on Gardasil video features  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., chairman and chief legal counsel for Children's  Health Defense,7  an organization originally founded in 2016 as World Mercury Project and  renamed in 2018 to focus on exposing and eliminating multiple harmful  exposures contributing to the epidemic of chronic ill health among  children. The video details the many safety problems associated with  Merck's HPV vaccine, Gardasil.  The information presented is based on publicly available government documents. Kennedy notes that, if what he says about Merck in this video presentation were untrue, they would be considered slanderous.  However, Kennedy says he is not concerned about being sued for  slander. He says he knows Merck won't sue, ""because in the U.S., truth  is an absolute defense against slander"" and Merck knows that, were the  company to sue for slander, Kennedy would file discovery requests that  would unearth even more documents detailing Merck's fraudulent  activities.  Kennedy's presentation does not go into the biological mechanisms by  which Gardasil causes harm. He directs parents and pediatricians to the  Children's Health Defense website8 to read peer reviewed medical literature sources for that information.  Instead, Kennedy's presentation focuses on what he describes as  Merck's fraudulent clinical trials of Gardasil vaccine, which were used  to gain FDA approval. While this article provides you with a summary of  the key points, I urge you to watch Kennedy's presentation in in its  entirety, as this information may well save you or your child a lifetime  of heartache and exorbitant medical expenses.      How Merck committed fraud in its Gardasil safety testing   Kennedy says the fraud Merck committed in its safety testing is a  testing Gardasil against a toxic placebo, and b hiding a 2.3  incidence of autoimmune disease occurring within seven months of  vaccination.  In his presentation, Kennedy shows Table 1 from the package insert9  for Gardasil, which looks at vaccine injuries at the site of injection.  It shows that Gardasil was administered to 5,088 girls another 3,470  received the control, amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate AAAH   a neurotoxic aluminum vaccine adjuvant that has been associated with  many serious vaccine injuries in the medical literature.  A third group, consisting of 320 individuals, received a proper placebo  saline. In the Gardasil and AAAH control groups, the number of  injuries were fairly close 83.9 in the Gardasil group and 75.4 in the  AAAH control group. Meanwhile, the rate of injury again, relating to  injuries at the injection site only, was significantly lower at 48.6.  Next, he shows Table 9 from the vaccine insert, which is the ""Summary  of girls and women 9 through 26 years of age who reported an incident  condition potentially indicative of a systemic autoimmune disorder after  enrollment in clinical trials of Gardasil, regardless of causality.""  These conditions include serious systemic reactions, chronic and  debilitating disorders and autoimmune diseases.  Now all of a sudden, there are only two columns, not three as shown  for the injection site injuries. The column left out is that of the  saline placebo group. Kennedy points out that Merck cleverly hides the  hazards of Gardasil by combining the saline group with the aluminum  control, thereby watering down the side effects reported in the  controls. ""They hide the saline group as a way of fooling you, your  pediatrician and the regulatory agency,"" Kennedy says.  Looking at the effects reported in the two groups, 2.3 of those  receiving Gardasil reported an effect of this nature, as did 2.3 of  those receiving the AAAH aluminum control or saline placebo. The same  exact ratio of harm is reported in both groups, which makes it appear as  though Gardasil is harmless.  In reality, we know very little about Gardasil vaccine safety from  the data as presented, since the vast majority of the controls were  given a toxic substance, and they don't tell us how many of those  receiving a truly inert substance developed these systemic injuries.  Still, we can draw some educated guesses, seeing how the injection site  injury ratios between Gardasil and the aluminum group were similar.  Merck's use of AAAH, a neurotoxic aluminum adjuvant instead of a  biologically inactive placebo, effectively nullifies its prelicensure  Gardasil safety testing.  As noted by Peter Gotzche with the Cochrane Center in 2016, when he  co-filed an unofficial complaint against the European Medical Agency for  bias in its assessment of the HPV vaccine, ""The use of active  comparators probably increased the occurrence of harms in the comparator  group, thereby masking harms caused by the HPV vaccine.""   Risk evaluation  When making an informed decision, you need to know both sides of the  equation  the risk you're trying to avoid, and the risk you're taking  on. Recall that, on average, 1 in 43,478 women will die from cervical  cancer.  If 2.3 of girls develop an autoimmune disease from Gardasil, then  that translates into 1,000 per 43,500. Even if a 1 in 43,478 chance of  dying from cancer is gone, does it makes sense to trade that for a 1 in  43 chance of getting an autoimmune disease?  And how many parents are comfortable giving a child a substance  knowing there's a 1 in 43 chance that this substance will cause a  lifelong disability? Yet that's the choice parents have been fooled into  making.   Protocol 18  Merck has not disclosed how many clinical safety trials also called  protocols it conducted for Gardasil. A slide in Kennedy's presentation  shows a listing of several of the ones known, including protocol 18.  Kennedy says this clinical trial is critical because that was the one  that FDA used as its basis for giving Merck a license to market the  vaccine for use in children as young as 9 years old.  Protocol 18 is the only trial in which the target audience, 9-  through 15-year-old girls and boys, was tested prelicensure. The other  trials looked at the vaccine's safety in 16- through 26-year-olds.  Protocol 18 included just 939 children  ""a very, very tiny group of  people,"" Kennedy says, ""for a product that is going to be marketed to  millions of children around the world.""  Aside from its small cohort size, protocol 18 is also filled with  ""fraud and flimflam,"" according to Kennedy. Merck presented protocol 18  to the FDA and HHS as the only safety trial that used a true  nonbioactive inert placebo. This, however, was a misrepresentation.  Instead of pure saline, the placebo used in protocol 18 contained a carrier solution composed of polysorbate 80  sodium borate borax, which is banned for food products in the U.S. and  Europe, genetically modified yeast, L-histidine and DNA fragments. In  essence, the ""placebo"" was all of the vaccine components with the  exception of the aluminum adjuvant and the antigen viral portion.  Very little if any safety testing has been done on these ingredients,  so their biological effects in the body are largely unknown. What we  can say for sure is that these are not inert substances like saline.  Still, the 596 children given the carrier solution control ""fared much  better than any other cohort in the study,"" Kennedy says.  None of them had any serious adverse events in the first 15 days.  Now, here's where Merck committed fraud yet again. As Kennedy points  out, Table 20 in protocol 18 shows that Merck cut the amount of aluminum  used in the Gardasil vaccine by half.  ""They tested a completely different formulation,"" he says.  ""And, obviously, they took the amount of aluminum out to reduce the  amount of injuries and mask the really bad safety profile of this  vaccine       Since Merck deceptively cut the amount of aluminum  Gardasil's  most toxic component  in half, the data from that study does not  support the safety of the standard Gardasil formulation. Since protocol  18 data are not based on the Gardasil vaccine formulation, the trial  constitutes scientific fraud.""       Exclusion criteria  Another bag of tricks  Kennedy also describes another trick used by Merck to skew results  exclusion criteria. By selecting trial participants that do not reflect  the general population, they mask potentially injurious effects on  vulnerable subgroups.  For example, individuals with severe allergies and prior genital  infections were excluded, as were those who'd had more than four sex  partners, those with a history of immunological or nervous system  disorders, chronic illnesses, seizure disorders, other medical  conditions, reactions to vaccine ingredients such as aluminum, yeast and  benzonase, and anyone with a history of drug or alcohol abuse.  Yet Merck recommends Gardasil for all of these unstudied groups.  Merck's investigators also had unlimited discretion to exclude anyone  with ""any condition which in the opinion of the investigator might  interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.""  Merck also used ""sloppy protocols to suppress reports of vaccine  injury,"" Kennedy says. For example, only 10 of participants were given  daily report cards to fill out, and they were only to be filled out for  14 days post-vaccination. What's more, these report cards only collected  information about vaccination site effects, such as redness, itching  and bruising.  Also ignored were autoimmune problems, seizures and menstrual cycle  disruptions experienced by many of the girls. They also did not follow  up with those who reported serious side effects. Merck also granted  broad discretionary powers to its paid investigators to determine what  they thought constituted a reportable adverse event and to dismiss  potential vaccine reactions.  The researchers did not systematically collect adverse event data,  which is the whole point of doing a safety study in the first place, and  by not paying for the additional time required by investigators to fill  out time-consuming adverse event reports, Merck effectively  incentivized the dismissal of side effects.  Many of the illnesses and injuries reported were also classified as  ""new medical conditions"" rather than adverse events, and no rigorous  investigation of these new conditions were performed.  According to Kennedy, at the time of the vaccine's approval, 49.5 of  the Gardasil group and 52 of the controls who received either the  aluminum adjuvant or the vaccine carrier solution had ""new medical  history"" after the seventh month Table 303, which included protocols 7,  13, 15 and 18, many of which were serious, chronic diseases.   Risk evaluation, take 2  Taking all of this into account, here's how the risk-benefit equation  looks now The 1 in 43,478 chance of dying from cervical cancer may  have been removed assuming the vaccine actually works, but by taking  the vaccine there is now a 1 in 43 chance of getting an autoimmune  disease, and a 1 in 2 chance of developing some form of serious medical  condition.   More lies   According to Kennedy, Merck also submitted fraudulent information to its Worldwide Adverse Experience System and the federal Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System VAERS about the death of Christina Tarsell, one of its study participants.  ""Merck claimed that Chris' gynecologist had told the company that her death was due to viral infection. Chris' gynecologist denies that she ever gave this information to Merck. To this day, Merck has refused to change its false entry on its own reporting system,"" Kennedy says.      ""Furthermore, Merck lied to the girls participating in these studies, telling them that the placebo was saline and contained no other ingredients. And No. 2, that the study in which they were participating was not a safety study. They were told that there had already been safety studies and that the vaccine had been proven safe        They made it so that the girls were less likely to report injuries associated with the vaccine, because they believed the vaccine they were receiving had already been proven safe and that any injuries did experience, maybe a month, two months or three months after the vaccine must just be coincidental and had nothing to do with the  vaccine.""     But it gets worse, because there's a possibility Gardasil could cause cancer. The Gardasil insert13  admits it has never been evaluated for carcinogenicity or genotoxicity,  yet its ingredients ""include potential carcinogens and mutagens,  including aluminum and human DNA,"" Kennedy says.  He goes on to show the results of Merck's study protocol 13 Table  17 Applicant's analysis of efficacy against vaccine-relevant HPV types  CIN 2/3 or worse among subjects who were PCR positive and seropositive  for relevant HPV types at day 1.  What this protocol showed is that women who had previous exposure to  the HPV strains used in the vaccine had a 44.6 increased risk of  developing CIN2 and CIN3 lesions after vaccination. Taking the dubious  efficacy of Gardasil into account, and the fact that it may only impact  one-third of cervical cancer cases, the risk-benefit lineup when taking  the vaccine now looks like this     There is still a chance of dying from cervical cancer unrelated to HPV   There is a 1 in 43 chance of getting an autoimmune disease  There is a 1 in 2 chance of developing a serious medical condition  If someone has ever been exposed to any of the nine HPV strains  included in the vaccine prior to getting Gardasil the risk of developing  CIN2 and CIN3 cervical lesions is raised by 44.6, which may raise the  risk of cervical cancer   Widespread Gardasil use may trigger more virulent HPV infections   ""To make things even worse, there are recent scientific studies that  suggest a phenomenon known as type replacement,"" Kennedy says. ""Type  replacement"" refers to when the elimination or suppression of one viral  strain allows a more virulent strain to colonize.   The study,14  ""Shift in Prevalence of HPV Types in Cervical Cytology Specimens in the  Era of HPV Vaccination,"" published in the journal Oncology Letters in  2016  which analyzed the association between the prevalence of 32 types  of HPV virus in 615 women who had abnormal cervical cytopathology   reported that  "" HPV16, which is recognized as the main HR-HPV type responsible  for the development of cervical cancer, was observed in 32.98 of HPV  participants, followed by HPV42 18.09, HPV31 17.66, HPV51  13.83, HPV56 10.00, HPV53 8.72 and HPV66 8.72.       The prevalence of HR-HPV types, which may be suppressed directly  in the case of HPV16 and 18, or possibly via cross-protection in the  case of HPV31 following vaccination, was considerably lower in  participants 22 years of age HPV16, 28.57 HPV18, 2.04 HPV31,  6.12, compared with participants 2329 years of age HPV16, 45.71  HPV18, 7.86 HPV31, 22.86, who were less likely to be vaccinated.       Consequently, the present study hypothesizes that there may be a  continuous shift in the prevalence of HPV types as a result of  vaccination. Furthermore, the percentage of non-vaccine HR-HPV types was  higher than expected, considering that eight HPV types formerly  classified as 'low-risk' or 'probably high-risk' are in fact HR-HPV  types.       Therefore, it may be important to monitor non-vaccine HPV types  in future studies, and an investigation concerning several HR-HPV types  as risk factors for the development of cervical cancer is required.""

What's up with this recent HPV vaccination BS?,"All the heartfelt commercials featuring children, and now they're pushing all boys to receive the HPV vaccine as well? This was never deemed necessary and now a 20k upvote post about how great it is for boys is near the front page on a major sub. When I grew up, only girls were required to have the vaccine. They describe it as very painful, unpleasant, and most likely unnecessary. Moreover, why the hell are these companies allowed to use ads to appeal to human emotion using children in heartfelt scenarios to convince parents to inject their children with unknown ingredients for the profit of pharmaceutical industries? How many people actually read the insert and understand enough to make a real decision? How many blindly believe the headlines and get their children injected in response to this classic media fear mongering?We live in a disgusting timeline of corporate profiteering at the expense of health and sanity, and it grows more absurd and unbelievable by the day, yet people are blinded and misled to be too mentally weak to seek out truth and think critically for themselves.

"Recommended to get the hpv vaccine but after reading online, I'm now worried. What are your facts and opinions and stories on the risks and harm?","I am 29, and have only had one sexual partner. Neither of us have tested positive for hpv. I have been recommended to get gardisil but everything I'm reading is scaring me. I'm reading about it potentially causing MS, ALS, death, increased cervical cancer, immune disorders etc and I'm terrified. The only reason I would get it to give me immunity to the other hpv caused cancers like throat, anal, skin. But even then from what I've read it really only lasts 5 years and doesn't even really offer much protection? Every thing I'm reading is very contradictory. Then there's the issue of how the studies that Merck themselves conducted are flawed and really shady and purposely didn't include and ignored certain reactions. People on here seem to be passionate about it so I'd really like to hear some solid based scientific facts of why I shouldn't get the vaccine.   On another note my friend got the first shot last week and did not read about it before doing getting it. I've told her what I'm reading about and she is now very upset that she got it. She's wondering if there's anything she can do to stop it before it takes over her immune system? And anything she can do to bond the aluminum and reduce it.    For the record I am not 100 pro or anti every vaccine, I like to do my own research on every single one I'm recommended. I think both sides have stupid sheep who don't actually understand what they're saying and just parrot what they've heard. Both sides do this. There are dumb anti vaccine people who just believe and repost completely insane memes that make absolutely no sense. Sometimes I think they are paid by the drug companies to make anti vaccine people look stupid. But I really can't stand the pro vaccine people who are pro every single vaccine and ""cancel"" anyone who even has a single doubt that they want clarified. They just repeat the drug companies own studies saying it's ""100 percent safe"" without actually knowing or understanding the studies or how they're conducted. Nuance is very important.

In 2017, the Indian Government dialed back Gates' vaccine regimen and evicted Gates and his cronies. Polio paralysis rates then dropped precipitously.","Vaccines, for Bill Gates, are a strategic philanthropy that feed his many vaccine-related businesses including Microsofts ambition to control a global vac ID enterprise and give him dictatorial control over global health policy  the spear tip of corporate neo-imperialism  Gates obsession with vaccines seems fueled by a messianic conviction that he is ordained to save the world with technology and a god-like willingness to experiment with the lives of lesser humans.  Promising to eradicate Polio with 1.2 billion, Gates took control of India s National Advisory Board NAB and mandated 50 polio vaccines up from 5 to every child before age 5.  Indian doctors blame the Gates campaign for a devastating vaccine-strain polio epidemic that paralyzed 496,000 children between 2000 and 2017.  In 2017, the Indian Government dialed back Gates vaccine regimen and evicted Gates and his cronies from the NAB. Polio paralysis rates dropped precipitously.  Evicted? Why not arrested  tried in a Court of Laws for Crime Against Humanity? The following hashtag is trending on social media jailBillGates  In 2017, the World Health Organization reluctantly admitted that the global polio explosion is predominantly vaccine strain, meaning it is coming from Gates Vaccine Program.  The most frightening epidemics in Congo, the Philippines, and Afghanistan are all linked to Gates vaccines. By 2018,  of global polio cases were from Gates vaccines.  In 2014, the Gates Foundation funded tests of experimental HPV vaccines, developed by GSK and Merck, on 23,000 young girls in remote Indian provinces.  Approximately 1,200 suffered severe side effects, including autoimmune and fertility disorders.  Seven died. Indian government investigations charged that Gates funded researchers committed pervasive ethical violations pressuring vulnerable village girls into the trial, bullying parents, forging consent forms, and refusing medical care to the injured girls.  The case is now in the countrys Supreme Court.  In 2010, the Gates Foundation funded a trial of a GSKs experimental malaria vaccine, killing 151 African infants and causing serious adverse effects including paralysis, seizure, and febrile convulsions to 1,048 of the 5,049 children.  During Gates 2002 MenAfriVac Campaign in Sub-Saharan Africa, Gates operatives forcibly vaccinated thousands of African children against meningitis.  Between 50-500 children developed paralysis. South African newspapers complained, We are guinea pigs for drug makers. Nelson Mandelas former Senior Economist, Professor Patrick Bond, describes Gates philanthropic practises as ruthless and immoral.  In 2010, Gates committed  10 billion to the WHO promising to reduce population, in part, through new vaccines. A month later Gates told a Ted Talk that new vaccines could reduce population.  In 2014, Kenyas Catholic Doctors Association accused the WHO of chemically sterilizing millions of unwilling Kenyan women with a phoney tetanus vaccine campaign.  Independent labs found the sterility formula in every vaccine tested. After denying the charges, WHO finally admitted it had been developing the sterility vaccines for over a decade.  Similar accusations came from Tanzania, Nicaragua, Mexico and the Philippines.

Our CDC director turned Merck president just dumped her Merck stocks...,"This is Julie Gerberding, she was the Director of the CDC from July 3, 2002 to January 20, 2009 when she resigned from her post.   She is now the President of Mercks Vaccine Division.  Gerberding is an Example of the Revolving Door Between the CDC and Vaccine Manufacturers.  In 2002, Gerberding became the first ever female Director for the CDC. While at the CDC, she single-handily overhauled the agencys entire organizational structure, causing many of the CDCs senior scientists and leaders to leave, while replacing them all with individuals who had ties to the vaccine industry.  During her time at the CDC, the FDA approved the HPV vaccine, Gardasil, manufactured by Merck.   This is important because in 2009, Gerberding resigned from her position at the CDC and then took over the position of President at Mercks vaccine division.  In other words, after she had given the green light to potentially one of the most dangerous vaccinations in history, she takes over the presidency at Merck and cashed in on the popularity of the vaccine approved by the CDC under her watch.  Recent SEC filings reveal that Mercks Vaccine Division President Julie Gerberding sold over half her Merck shares in January for 9.1 Million.   That transaction folllowed a spate of bad news for Mercks Gardasil vaccine  Last month Cancer Research UK announced an alarming 54 rise in cervical cancer among 24-29 year olds,the first generation to receive the HPV jabs.   The following day, the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine published a withering critique of Gardasils crooked clinical trials,It is still uncertain whether human papillomavirus HPV vaccination prevents cervical cancer as trials were not designed to detect this outcome .   As Gerberding knows, those trials revealed that Gardasil dramatically RAISES by46the risk of cervical cancer among women previously exposed to HPV.   That may explain the cancer explosions in England and other nations with high inoculation rates Australia, France, Sweeden and Norway.   A 2019 study of Alabama girls found the highest Cervical Cancer rates in the states most heavily vaccinated counties.   With Mercks efficacy pretensions circling the drain, a coalition of leading plaintiffs lawyers are already in discovery in a suit alleging that Merck fraudulently concealed  serious illnesses affecting half,and  autoimmune diseases affecting 1 of every 37 girls in Gardasils clinical trials within 6 months of injection.   As CDC Director 2002-2009,Gerberding helped Merck paper over those efficacy and safety problems.   In 2006 she gave Merck the CDC recommendation that made Gardisil a 3.5 Billion blockbuster.   Gerberding did other lucrative favors for Merck   blocking whistleblower Gary Goldman from disclosing that Mercks chicken pox vaccine was causing a deadly shingles epidemic,   silencing and punishing Whistleblower Dr William Thompson when he told her CDC bigwigs were destroying data linking Mercks MMR to autism,  allowing the company to illegally reformulate its MMR mumps component.   Those courtesies earned her the Merck sinecure and stock options.   Merck Is now fighting existential fraud lawsuits on both the MMR and Gardasil that threaten licensing for those key products.

"Summary of the evidence on the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccines","Umbrella review of systematic reviews      Abstract   Background This objective of this umbrella review was to summarize the evidence on safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of human papillomavirus HPV vaccines in the general population.   Methods The authors conducted a literature search and selected systematic reviews if they were published from January 2006 through November 2018, included randomized controlled trials or observational studies, related to the general population, and evaluated HPV vaccinerelated clinical outcomes. The authors independently and in duplicate screened literature, extracted data, and appraised reviews using AMSTAR 2, a critical appraisal tool for systematic reviews.   Results The authors selected 30 systematic reviews that included male and female participants aged 9 through 76 years from multiple countries. Reviews evaluated postvaccine seroconversion, HPV infection rates, precancerous or benign lesions, and adverse events none of the researchers reported on oral or oropharyngeal lesions. Results from the reviews showed that, compared with those who received a placebo or nonHPV-type vaccine, HPV-vaccinated participants had statistically significantly higher rates of seroconversion and local adverse events, statistically significantly lower rates of HPV infection and condylomata lesions, and decreased rates of HPV-related precancerous lesions, which did not always attain statistical significance.   Conclusions Systematic reviews have found evidence that the available HPV vaccines are safe, effective, and efficacious against vaccine-type HPV infection and HPV-associated cellular changes, including precancerous and benign lesions.","{'labels': ['neutral'], 'scores': [0.999005138874054]}"
No Association between HPV Vaccination and Infertility in U.S. Females 1833 Years Old,"After rigorous discussion down in the comments the statement below has been recanted.  We were able to ascertain that self-reported data is not strong and we shouldn't be making conclusions from it.  Among the comments was u/Reishey who corrected me that this mode of evidence is not sufficient to reach robust, peer reviewed conclusions.  His comparison to VAERS was pertinent and I think we can learn a lot from that comparison.  Unverified, self-reported data is not sufficient and the use of it leads to misinformation.  I think we can put to bed the idea that HPV vaccination leads to fertility issues e.g. sterility.  That's dangerous misinformation.    Conclusion  There was no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. These results provide further evidence of HPV vaccine safety and should give providers confidence in recommending HPV vaccination. Further research should explore protective effects of HPV vaccines on female and male fertility.","{'labels': ['neutral'], 'scores': [0.9981281161308289]}"

Vaccines can cause severe bodily harm and people are right in being hesitant with them peer reviewed sources included.,"Hello,  I am writing this on a throwaway account because I will inevitably receive a myriad of downvotes and mean spirited comments / messages towards me just because of the title alone. Before anyone makes any assumptions about me, I am not a conservative / republican and do not support Donald Trump in any way whatsoever. During the 2020 election year, I threw my support mainly behind Bernie Sanders, Andrew Yang, and the Green Party. That should give you a good idea of what my political affiliations are and whatnot. Keep in mind that I am not a doctor, I am just a guy who did some research. If you are an open minded individual, please keep reading because I believe that there is a plethora of evidence showcasing that vaccines can cause severe bodily harm. My main beliefs are as follows  - One objective of vaccines is to harm people with chronic illness Guillain Barre Syndrome, Type 1 Diabetes, Cancers, etc. in order to essentially turn them into ""cash cows"" for the pharmaceutical industry. People with chronic illness usually need medicine and treatments for the rest of their lives, becoming extremely profitable for the industry. This adds to the profit pharmaceutical companies make off the initial selling of the vaccine. This also prevents people from going ""off the grid"", so to speak.  - Vaccines should have at the bare minimum some kind of safety warning label on them similar to cigarettes.  Most of the links that I will post below will be peer reviewed and will inherently explain the reasoning behind my beliefs. Some of the abstracts that will be posted will be shortened so that only the most important parts are shown for spacing reasons. As always, please review all sources for  yourself.  Relating to Hib vaccines -    Abstract - ""We present two cases of bacterial meningitis caused by Haemophilus  influenzae type b Hib which developed a few days after conjugate Hib  vaccination. This phenomenon of postimmunization provocative time period  is reviewed and discussed. These cases serve as a reminder to  clinicians of the risk, albeit rare, of invasive Hib disease in the  short period after successful immunization.""    Abstract - ""VAERS received 29,747 reports after Hib vaccines 5179 17 were  serious, including 896 reports of deaths. Median age was 6 months range  0-1022 months. Sudden infant death syndrome was the stated cause of  death in 384 51 of 749 death reports with autopsy/death certificate  records.""    Abstract - ""Vaccine-related cardiorespiratory events are relatively common in  preterm babies. Problems were much more common if vaccine is  administered at or before 70 d. These babies should therefore be  monitored postvaccination. Further prospective studies are needed to  clarify whether delaying vaccination offers protection against these  adverse events.""    Abstract - ""The hemophilus vaccine has been linked to the development of autoimmune  type 1 diabetes, insulin dependent diabetes IDDM in ecological  studies.""    Abstract - ""The Guillain-Barr syndrome GBS is an immune-mediated disease often  associated with viral or bacterial infections and with immunisation. IgM  antibodies have been implicated as the main trigger event in GBS. So  far, only four cases of GBS have been observed following immunisation  with a conjugate vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae type b.""    Abstract - ""We initiated and funded a collaborative study with Tuomilehto on the effect of the Haemophilus influenzae type  b vaccine on type 1 diabetes and found that the data support a causal  relation paper submitted for publication. Furthermore, the potential  risk of the vaccine exceeds the potential benefit.""  Relating to HPV vaccines -    Abstract - ""Three young women who developed premature ovarian insufficiency  following quadrivalent human papillomavirus HPV vaccination presented  to a general practitioner in rural New South Wales, Australia. The  unrelated girls were aged 16, 16, and 18 years at diagnosis. Each had  received HPV vaccinations prior to the onset of ovarian decline.""    Abstract - ""We documented here the evidence of the potential of the HPV vaccine to  trigger a life-disabling autoimmune condition. The increasing number of  similar reports of post HPV vaccine-linked autoimmunity and the  uncertainty of long-term clinical benefits of HPV vaccination are a  matter of public health that warrants further rigorous inquiry.""    Abstract - ""This patient presented with amenorrhoea after identifying a change from  her regular cycle to irregular and scant periods following vaccinations  against human papillomavirus. Premature ovarian failure was then notified as a possible adverse event following this vaccination.""    Abstract - ""Mumps parotitis may lead to expression and immune recognition of a tumor-associated form of MUC1 and create effective immune surveillance of ovarian cancer cells that express this  form of MUC1.""    Abstract - ""An increasing number of cases of POI post-HPV4 are being reported.  Possible mechanisms for the suspected effect of HPV on female  reproductive function are a toxic effect or an autoimmune response. The  trigger could be the vaccine immunogen contents or the adjuvants, the  latter are used to increase the immune reaction. The adjuvant in HPV4  contains aluminum. Animal models have shown aluminum exposure to inhibit  expression of female reproductive hormones and to induce histologic  changes in the ovaries. Specific genetic compositions may be more  susceptible to developing an autoinflammatory syndrome after exposure to  an environmental factor.""  Relating to vaccines and autism -    Abstract - ""The results suggest that although mercury has been removed from many  vaccines, other culprits may link vaccines to autism. Further study into  the relationship between vaccines and autism is warranted.""    Abstract - ""In 2004, the US Center for Disease Control CDC published a paper  showing that there is no link between the age at which a child is  vaccinated with MMR and the vaccinated children's risk of a subsequent  diagnosis of autism. One of the authors, William Thompson, has now  revealed that statistically significant information was deliberately  omitted from the paper. Hooker analysed the raw data from the CDC study afresh. He confirmed  that the risk of autism among African American children vaccinated  before the age of 2 years was 340 that of those vaccinated later.""    Abstract - ""The CDC's current stance that Thimerosal is safe and that there is no  relationship between Thimerosal and autism is based on six specific  published epidemiological studies coauthored and sponsored by the CDC.  The purpose of this review is to examine these six publications and  analyze possible reasons why their published outcomes are so different  from the results of investigations by multiple independent research  groups over the past 75 years.""    Abstract - ""We suggest that an inappropriate antibody response to MMR, specifically the measles component thereof, might be related to pathogenesis of autism.""    Abstract - ""Boys vaccinated as neonates had threefold greater odds for autism  diagnosis compared to boys never vaccinated or vaccinated after the  first month of life. Non-Hispanic white boys were 64 less likely to  have autism diagnosis relative to nonwhite boys. Findings suggest that  U.S. male neonates vaccinated with the hepatitis B vaccine prior to 1999  from vaccination record had a threefold higher risk for parental  report of autism diagnosis compared to boys not vaccinated as neonates  during that same time period. Nonwhite boys bore a greater risk.""    Abstract - ""Our results show that i children from countries with the highest ASD  prevalence appear to have the highest exposure to Al from vaccines ii  the increase in exposure to Al adjuvants significantly correlates with  the increase in ASD prevalence in the United States observed over the  last two decades Pearson r0.92, p0.0001 and iii a significant  correlation exists between the amounts of Al administered to preschool  children and the current prevalence of ASD in seven Western countries,  particularly at 3-4 months of age Pearson r0.89-0.94,  p0.0018-0.0248. The application of the Hill's criteria to these data  indicates that the correlation between Al in vaccines and ASD may be  causal. Because children represent a fraction of the population most at  risk for complications following exposure to Al, a more rigorous  evaluation of Al adjuvant safety seems warranted.""    Abstract - ""Thimerosal, a preservative added to many vaccines, has become a major  source of mercury in children who, within their first two years, may  have received a quantity of mercury that exceeds safety guidelines. A review of medical literature and US government data suggests that i  many cases of idiopathic autism are induced by early mercury exposure  from thimerosal ii this type of autism represents an unrecognized  mercurial syndrome and iii genetic and non-genetic factors establish a  predisposition whereby thimerosal's adverse effects occur only in some  children.""

Husband got hpv anal warts,"Hello   Hope you guys can tell me something, because I can't find much information about it to my case.  BTW not in the US.i know its easier to get it there.   Of course I have read online about hpv.  So my husband got hpv. He got anal warts. Found out recently. He's under treatment.  Don't judge .  I went to my general practitioner to ask some questions. She didn't help, but rather it sounded like she made fun of me.  I know that he's infectious when he got an outbreak and around that area, the warts. Is he also infectious ""at his dick""? Like if we jerk off together or I blow him... Can I get it? Additionally after he has been treated, all is gone and is healed, how long should we wait? Of course physician could answer, I read about 3 ot 6 months... That correct? Just wanted to gather some information.  Basically my doctor just acted weird and said, if you don't wanna get it, use condom, though u still can infect yourself with hpv. If you wanna be sure, just don't have sex anymore.  I am thinking about getting the hpv vaccine, would pay it myself, but it's almost impossible to get it for me. They only give the vaccine to young boys, very rarely to adults. The doctor even said, it's forbidden to give it to adult males, which is clearly a lie. But you would need to find a doctor, argue with him and convince him, which is very difficult lol. So it's almost impossible for me to get. It's so crazy even though I got the money and want it, the doctors are not allowing me, which makes me mad. I didn't fave up yet, but I don't see a big chance in the moment.  So... My question is just... Is my husband also at other parts of his body infectious and also when he doesn't have sores and anal warts?  I tried to ask the doctor, couldn't answer.

The doctors I have talked to told me it's either not possible or useless. At least one doctor made some effort in explaining. It still contradicts what I have read online.  Some organization clearly recommend the vaccination.  Yes I have been sexual active. I had no hoe phase, Max maybe 10 partners with 35 and with those maybe some mild sex. Yes the frequency and sex acts don't depict the chance of contracting hpv. Doctors said I could even get it with a handshake.  So... The one doctor said with 35 I almost for sure, with almost 100 percent have already hpv. So it would be for almost 100 percent useless in getting it.  Additionally what makes it worse or more confusing to me is, that my husband got hpv and anal warts. He got them treated recently.  They told me basically I could always get infected by him, only way to not get it is not having sex. I am just confused about, should I just accept, that maybe, if not having it already, I will get from him hpv and maybe also anal warts?  I know that not everyone gets anal warts and that even if he got them I don't necessarily need to get them.  But does it sound weird if I say it kinda scares me a bit and makes me feeling uneased?

How do people feel about Novavax's vaccine?,"Unlike Pfizer and Moderna's vaccine which both utilize mRNA technology, Novavax's vaccine takes a protein subunit approach.

Should I get the HPV vaccine as an adult man?,"I have health anxiety. Since I've learned about HPV related cancers, whenever I go down on a girl I get anxiety about it for weeks, so I've simply stopped doing it. This is sad for me I like oral and unfair to the girl who probably also likes oral.   For years I just bemoaned the fact that I missed the boat when it came to boys getting vaccines, but then I realized, why not just get one anyway?  My thinking if I already got and cleared a dangerous strain I'll never know, and the vaccine will give me some peace of mind in the future.   If I haven't gotten a dangerous strain yet, the vaccine will likely protect me from it. Plus, I've read that men can be reinfected with the same strain multiple times -- though I'm not sure whether that's Gardisil propaganda.   Based on my reading, there just doesn't seem to be a reason not to get the vaccine later in life. And medicine seems to concur starting from 2022, men in my country will get Gardisil insured up until the age of 26. Unfortunately, I'm 29, which leaves me with a massive downside the cost. I'd pay 480 euros for all three shots. Of course, this is a fair price for peace of mind, and next to nothing when it comes to preventing cancer, but it's a steep cost for a vaccine I may not truly need at all. I mean, I guess there's a reason why most men my age are not vaccinated and worry very little about it. Am I just feeding my anxiety or is there some merit in me getting the vaccine at my age?   Also, are there any risks tied to getting the vaccine later in life when I may or may not already have had the strains the vaccine guards against?","{'labels': ['confusion', 'realization'], 'scores': [0.46179378032684326, 0.9684905409812927]}"

Recently diagnosed with HPV and not sure what to expect?,"I F19 was diagnosed with HPV a few days ago.

Need some information about getting HPV Vaccine while being on PEP,"Im a 25M who had sex for the first time with an escort on 05/19/22 who says that she is on PrEP and gets tested regularly. I received unprotected oral sex and had protected vaginal sex. We also did some kissing but I dont think it was deep kissing. I really regret doing this.  Even though she says she gets regularly tested and is on PrEP, Im really freaking out. I went to a clinic that does STD/HIV Testing the day after having sex. I know that for accurate results its better to wait two weeks, but I just wanted PEP so I can have a peace of mind for extra precaution. So Im currently on PEP making sure to take it on time and have experienced some of the side effects such as diarrhoea and fatigue.   Im also thinking of getting the HPV Vaccine even though I had sex. I got three doses the of HPV QVAL from 12/08/11, 02/09/12, and 05/22/12. I want to get the updated vaccine that covers 9 strains not just 4. But Im curious if this could affect the PEP Biktarvy medication that Im currently on?      Im also looking for any possible symptoms for STDs as my mind is freaking out. I think since the weekend my pubic area was itchy, specifically the base of the penis/bottom of pubic area and side of my balls. But I think its because I shaved earlier last week Im a hairy guy and hair grows back quickly so I think its the hair growing back and especially focus on balls and base of penis. The hairs can be sharp and the friction with my boxers seem to made it irritable. Though its not itching anymore. There is only a normal itch that typically happens even before I had sex.  The back of my throat kinda feels weird but no pain. I dont know if its a sore throat but when Im swallowing saliva its weird. I think on Google its saying Globus sensation. This sort of happened on Saturday and I went to a different clinic to see what was up. The doctor said it was just congestion with the mucus buildup so he prescribed me Loratadine Claritin. I havent taken it yet because I dont know if its ok to take it with PEP.  There is some discomfort on mainly the part where my left buttocks ends and thigh starts and my right one as well. I sit a lot on my computer chair which is a cheap office chair from Amazon so not the most comfortable thing and Ive had this sort of discomfort before from sitting on it for long periods of time. Im usually sitting on the chair using my PC for work or personal.   Sorry for the really long post. Im just scared right now about getting some of the STDs such as HIV, HPV, HSV. Im definitely not going to have any casual sex in my live now that Im terrified.   TLDR Lost my virginity with an escort. Had protected vaginal sex but unprotected oral sex and some kissing. Now Im scared of STD/HIV so Im on PEP Biktarvy. Wondering if is ok to get HPV Vaccine 9 while on PEP.

HPV Disclosure of exposure then what? ,"Hi everyone! I hope you are all taking care.    I have a story to share and some questions to pose about HPV, as follows.    I 32M had an exposure to a high risk strain of HPV back in December 2021, whereby I had sex with a girl 32F for ONE day. The high risk strain of HPV she had was NOT 16 or 18, thankfully  it was just flagged as other high risk we used condoms for vaginal sex, had mutual unprotected oral sex, and deep open mouth kissing.    I found out about her HPV status only some days later, after she got the results of her Pap which showed CIN1/LSIL and HPV tests  both performed on the same cervical sample. Side note She has never had any kind of warts.    As you can imagine, this made me worry! However, one good thing here is that since then I have had no HPV symptoms of any kind, either in my genital, anal, or oral areas 8 doctors in 3 countries some were GPs, some were STD specialists have examined me since then and found none. I understand that HPV is usually asymptomatic in males, though.    Regarding my future partners I have decided to disclose everything to them, although all 8 doctors told me that I do NOT have to disclose anything regarding HPV, since I was NOT diagnosed with it, apart from one doctor, maybe, who said that disclosing shows that you care about the other person. I agree!    My questions  1. If I meet a girl that is consenting to have sex with me after I disclose everything to her about my HPV exposure, then can I go on and have sex with her? 2. If she wants to have sex with me after taking only 1 or 2 shots out of the 3 of the vaccine, then is it OK if we have sex then? 3. Or shall I perhaps strongly insist that we abstain from sex for 6-7 months until she gets all 3 shots of the vaccine? 4. I understand that this is up to her to decide, right? Of course, I will respect her choice! 5. Is there anything else I should do on my end?    My plan is to go see a doctor together, so that she can make an informed decision which I will respect, of course.    As you can see, my situation is a bit tricky as I only had one short protected exposure, more than a year ago, and no symptoms thus far, so there is a good chance that I never contracted anything. However, I have decided that disclosing my experience would be the best for me and my partners.    Sorry for the many questions sometimes I overthink things and panic! This whole HPV exposure experience has made me somewhat anxious and worried about sex, but I am slowly working on it     Thank you very, very much and Happy Holidays!    PS-1. I started my HPV vaccine series earlier this year I have had 2 shots so far.  PS-2 I have been sexually active since 19 years old.","{'labels': ['curiosity'], 'scores': [0.819687008857727]}"

How much sex is too much for a teenage boy?,"Hey, I'm using a throwaway account because my son follows me on reddit.   I 39f am a single mother raising 1 teenage boy who's in highschool. His Father is no longer in the picture, so taking care of him is my responsibility entirely. My son is well behaved, does decently in school and plays on the basketball team. I couldn't provide him with everything, but I tried my best to be the best and most supportive parent I could.  As a Mother, I didn't want to repress my son's sexuality or teach him abstinence only sex education, so I taught him about protection, STDs and basically everything I could. I grew up in a somewhat sex-positive household and I wanted to provide a safe and supportive environment for my son as well.  When my son lost his virginity he confided in me and we discussed his feelings about it. Since then, he has trusted in talking to me about his sexuality and came to me for advice which I gave to the best of my ability.  However, some things have occurred in the past few months which prompted me to make this post. Since July, my son has been hooking up with many women at our house and presumably at parties or other locations. Most of the girls either attend his school and are around his age, but others attend college and are in their early to mid twenties. This bothered me initially, but since everyone is above the age of consent, I don't really have a problem with it.  On one hand, I'm glad my son has the opportunity to explore his sexuality and seems to be satisfied with his experiences, but on the other hand I'm worried that it's distracting from his responsibilities and it may affect his ability to form meaningful relationships in the future. Lastly, I know it doesn't matter, but his ""body-count"" is quite high for his age and I just want him to fit in and be normal.

HPV advice needed,"Hi guys.  I recently went in for my first Pap smear which came back with a small abnormality.

However they never tested me for HPV.   But my post isn't about myself, it's about my boyfriend. About a month after started having sex he noticed some small bumps on his shaft and at the base of his penis. They don't necessarily look like warts or have that cauliflower characteristic, but some of them do produce like dry flakey skin. When I got my Pap smear results back abnormal and got word that it was probably low grade HPV I really started to panic. I called the office back and told a nurse my situation. She assured me that I most likely did not pass an HPV strain with symptoms to my partner considering my pap came back only slightly abnormal and I'm fully vaccinated. She even told me that as long as I'm with the same partner, I don't need to start using condoms. I also know that HPV usually does not have symptoms in men. I honestly chalked it up to the fact that we were having sex a couple times a day and it could be wearing at his skin. However, we are currently doing long distance and haven't had sex in a month and a half and his bumps haven't fully gone away. He still hasn't gone to the doctor. How big of a possibility is it that I passed a strain of HPV to him that is producing symptoms? Are there any other possibilities to what's going on?

"Diagnosed with HPV and Genital Warts, but now I've got other strange symptoms...","Hi all -  A couple of days ago I went in to see a doctor, and she found genital warts on my labia fucking great. She told me I had HPV, and wrote me a prescription for the Gardasil vaccine.   What prompted me to go in I started having pain during sex - not deep pain, but anytime my bf would start to slide in, the pain due to friction was substantial.   I need you guys to give me some peace of mind, because since she diagnosed me, all I can think is that I've got cervical cancer even though she said the HPV that causes warts does NOT cause cancer.   Long story short, as soon as I left the clinic, I went and got the Gardasil vaccine. I was told that it prevents me from possibly getting other strains, and may help clear up existing warts I only have a few. Full disclosure I'm also currently on birth control alesse.   I've had sex once since this diagnoses, and after sex, I had a tiny bit of blood in my vaginal fluid super small, kind of like minor spotting you get from being on BC. I read that this is likely because of friction irritating the few warts I do have.  After getting the diagnoses and vaccine last Tuesday, fast forward to yesterday, I woke up with pain that honestly felt like trapped gas. First my abdomen had recurring sharp pain, then under my ribs, then a bit of soreness in my legs lol, I know - I sound like a hypochondriac.

As of this morning, I'm not nearly as gassy, but I definitely have some stomach pain and lighter feeling of trapped gas seems to be contained to my stomach area today.   Not gonna lie, I feel better typing this out. I'm going to get a PAP tomorrow just to make sure things are okay, but I'm low key terrified I have cervical cancer after being diagnosed with HPV.   From what I've read, warts appear 4-5 months after being infected even though the warts are associated with non-cancer causing HPV, I read it takes years if not decades for cervical cancer to develop.   I guess my question is, has anyone else experienced this? Does HPV with warts cause trapped gas? I'm wondering if maybe it's just my birth control?   Help  Some words of comfort are welcomed - this shit is keeping me up at night!!","{'labels': ['fear'], 'scores': [0.9807354807853699]}"

My most recent impressions.,"Thanks to all the diligently posted links and the service that this sub has provided, whereby I have been able to - upon a daily basis, to proceed with an ever evolving and developing education and sense of the vaccines and their meaning and of their effects in our lives and our society it becomes clearer by the day that the 'Covid - 19 pandemic' is a property of a marketing campaign, that has been violently imposed upon humanity.   A very significant portion of this humanity, are psychotic, hopelessly lost, negligent or criminal, and incapable of performing any rational judgements or assessments of these developments. The 'mass formation psychosis' is very real and it is this psychosis, which is the driver, and the energetic supply for the mass murder which is now sweeping the globe.  I recently watched a documentary about the HPV vaccines. In summary Innocent young women are told that there is a virus, which will give them cancer, if they get it. They are offered a vaccine, which will protect them. They take it. But the vaccine has no innoculative propery there is no virus that can give them cancer, and the vaccine, rather than being merely saline that has been sold to them on a lie - has been trialled and precisely designed to destroy a portion of these young women by the tuned toxic effect.  This HPV vaccine model has been exported to the entire planet in the Covid - 19 marketing campaign. We have not merely been conned into paying for a harmless shot that we do not need. We have purchased death or rather mega death, or perhaps even giga death? Time will tell.  Every day for these last two years, I have tried to grasp what it is that separates or defines the two groups - the willing victims of the slaughter, and the ones who desire to survive uncontaminated by the murdering hand of the vaccines. I spend hours every day wondering, but I still do not have a satisfactory answer.","{'labels': ['gratitude', 'neutral'], 'scores': [0.6874521374702454, 0.3711381256580353]}"
"Risk of GuillainBarr syndrome after vaccination against human papillomavirus a systematic review and meta-analysis, 1 January 2000 to 4 April 2020","  Background  GuillainBarr syndrome GBS is a rare autoimmune disease that can follow viral infections and has in a few cases been linked to vaccinations. Pre-licensure clinical trials did not observe an association between human papillomavirus HPV vaccination and GBS, a post-marketing study from 2017 reported an increased relative risk.   Aim  We assessed the risk of GBS after HPV vaccination through a systematic literature review and meta-analysis.   Methods  We searched Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane for studies reporting on the risk of GBS after HPV vaccination in individuals aged  9 years, published between 1 January 2000 and 4 April 2020, excluding studies without a comparator group. Seven studies reporting relative effect sizes were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. We assessed quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. Study protocol was registered PROSPERO No. CRD42019123533.   Results  Of 602 identified records, we included 25 studies. Based on over 10 million reports, cases of GBS were rare. In 22 studies no increased risk was observed, while in three studies a signal of increased risk of GBS after HPV vaccination was identified. Meta-analysis yielded a pooled random-effects ratio of 1.21 95 CI 0.602.43 I2  72 95 CI 3688. This translates to a number needed to harm of one million to be vaccinated to generate one GBS case. Quality of evidence was very low.   Conclusions  The absolute and relative risk of GBS after HPV vaccination is very low and lacks statistical significance. This is reassuring for the already implemented vaccination programmes and should be used in respective communication activities.","{'labels': ['neutral'], 'scores': [0.998991072177887]}"

I seriously do not know how we will accomplish abstainance after not seeing eachother for over 4 months, as much as I understand the risk of spreading HPV.       If we have sex but I am vaccinated, am I unlikely to contract GW? Will a barrier method prevent the spread? I have read that it is not 100 because HPV spreads through skin to skin contact. Is oral sex dangerous?

The transformative impact of HPV vaccines,"From the article  In How HPV vaccination has changed HPV epidemiology and HPV-related disease, Lauri Markowitz, MD, team lead, human papillomavirus HPV, associate director of science, CDC,  Atlanta, Georgia, shared an analysis of the transformative impact of human papillomavirus HPV vaccines. Prophylactic HPV vaccines have demonstrated remarkable efficacy,  exceeding 98, and they are already proving to be effective in the prevention of anogenital warts, precancerous lesions, and cancer alike. ...  One marker of vaccination impact has been the decline in prevalence of genital warts. In those aged 14 to  19 years, there was a 56 reduction in prevalence from 2007 to 2010 comparing pre- and postvaccine eras. As coverage increased, there was an 88 reduction in vaccine-type HPV prevalence in this age group in 2018.  While monitoring the impact on cervical precancer screening is challenging because of evolving screening recommendations, there has been a significant decrease in precancerous  lesions among younger age groups, while an increase was observed in older age groups possibly due to increased  detection and improved screening. Interestingly, these declines were strongest for vaccine types, with some additional evidence of cross-protection for nonvaccine types.

Missing HPV vaccine,"Hi there! A bit about me I'm a 24 year old man, and I'm a virgin, basically due to being really shy and having a bunch of stigma and fear about sex instilled in me through going to Catholic school. Anyway, I've recently been talking to a girl, Beth, through Tinder, and her bio seems to indicate that she is looking for something short-term and sexual. She is in an open relationship, and is just looking for fun. Her bio also has some suggestive innuendos. When she first proposed that we should meet up, she suggested that we should get together and watch a movie at her place or mine - the plan only changed when we realized that neither of us would be able to host.

I don't want to come across as too presumptuous, since our conversation was never explicitly sexual, but given the context it seems only fair to let her know. I've also never dealt with having to discuss my sexual health with someone, so it seems weird to hard pivot into that discussion. On top of that, I'm just kind of mad at myself that I hadn't realized and fixed the problem sooner.  Any advice is appreciated, thanks!

legal sex question hpv,"I am a 38 year old male. I got with a girl in early 2004. I had a little smell for like a day, but it went away and did not think anything of it. Then I got with a different girl in the spring. She said she had had an irregular pap before I got with her. That girl and I lived together for the summer. While I was living with her I noticed a small red bump on my pubic line that looked like a pimple. I did not think anything of it. The girl went away to Europe for the fall semester. While she was gone the red bump turned into a small wart at my pubic line. I got the wart removed. I went to visit her in Europe and did not tell her because the wart was at my waist and I did not know if it was genital HPV or not, she had already been exposed from sex that spring and summer, and I did not want to ruin her time in Europe that semester. This was 18 years ago and I still do not know if she was with anybody else in Europe. She returned to the United States and I was going to visit her at her college in 2005. The wart returned and I went to get it removed and the nurse put too much TCA acid on my waist and it burned the skin around the wart and left a scab. I went to visit her at her college and I guess I guess I was thinking it was the last I would be seeing of her for a while and the wart was above my pubic area so I thought it might not be genital and told her the scab was from an iron and we had sex. One night the condom broke and she got the morning after pill. Our next sexual experience she asked if I wanted to have sex without a condom and we did. A couple months later a wart appeared at the base of my penis and I told her and she was nice. We went to a concert together later that year. Then I did not see her for two years and went I did see her we kissed and cuddled. Then I visited her later in the year and we had sex again in 2007. I had wrote about this in my online biography and nobody said anything then she started trying to have my whole city say the sex with the scab was rape. She consented to the sex and I am just some guy who wishes the best for all living things dealing with something from 18 years ago.      In 2006 I 69ed with a girl at a party without telling her I had had a wart on my pubic line and at the base of my penis. We then had sex another night. Then we had sex in the morning. We wore condoms for the vaginal sex. I did not say anything to her about the HPV because I thought my body was clear of whatever I had. She is now calling me a rapist.      That girl heard I had sex with a girl in the bathroom of a hotel type place I was working front desk at in 2007when I started sucking on the girls tits in the bathroom while I was working and she asked 'Are you doing your job?' I said I was working and she replied 'If you were doing your job you would get a condom.', so I got a condom and she placed herself on top of on my dick and rode for a while then I did her missionary style. The girl returned the next year to go camping with me but I was paranoid I was getting something and just cuddled with her instead of having sex. I did not tell her about the HPV because I thought my body was clear of whatever I had. Now people in my city are saying it was rape.

Life 40 years after exposure to HPV .... Vaccinate,"Some time between 1982 and 1988 I was exposed to HPV. I was only active with two women, my ex-wife and the long term love interest after the ex. No warts, no symptoms ever. Married second wife in 1995.  2019 through 2022 exposed to Covid 5 times. 9/21 developed a lump on the left side of my throat, attending thought is was Covid related, nothing ever done about it. 9/22 saw an MD for it, sent to an oncologist, CT's and MRI's completed, biopsy taken, tested positive for squamas cells, site of infection was the remnants of the left tonsil.  Surgery resulted in 42 lymph nodes removed, a nerve and some mass removed. 30 radiation treatments completed. Scans claimed area clear in March of this year. In May, I developed irritation behind my left eye, back in for imaging. All teeth were extracted prior to radiation started right before christmas. Craniotomy biopsy completed a month ago, squamas mass growth around the left carotid artery. I've heard NOTHING from the ""team"" coordinating my care during this past month. I guess they have given up, just hurts that there has been no communication since the biopsy, too much left up in the air.

Gardasil 9 Vaccine helpful?,"So Ive struggled on and off with plantar and common warts since I was a teenager. One dermatologist recommended I try to boost my immune system to fight off warts as freezing and other methods didnt keep them from coming back. It worked about 5 years ago when I added zinc, multivitamin, vitamin c, Tagamet, etc. to my regimen. Obviously, I dont know what worked, but regardless, it worked. I was told that since my body recognized the virus now, I should never have a recurrence. Well, about 3 years ago, I think I found a new wart on my foot. I did at home therapy freezing and SA and it took care of it. Shortly after that, I think one appeared on my hand in which I left it alone because I wasnt sure. I was also battling major contact dermatitis on my hands during Covid probably due to overuse of hand sanitizers. Well, a couple weeks ago, it looks like a similar one appeared on the same hand which made me wonder if it is warts. I did also notice a white growth on my tongue late last year, but I was in my 2nd/3rd trimester so thought it was some weird pregnancy thing. I just had a biopsy done on the tongue growth and it came back as benign squamous papilloma. Im devastated. Ive since again started my regimen of multivitamins A,D,E,B Complex, additional vitamin D I was deficient during pregnancy per my lab results, vitamin C 1000mg, and zinc sulfate 50mg elemental per day as well as a topical zinc sulfate cream for the spots on my hands. So far, not seeing much change but its also only been a little over a week since I started my vitamin regimen.   Ive never had any indication of GW or abnormal Pap smears. Im married and monogamous with someone Ive been with for 9 years. Could the tongue growth be from hand warts? Ive read its a possibility. Ive never had anything like it.    Im 28F thats battled plantar and common warts since I was about 11 or 12 years old. I honestly dont eat a balanced diet but rarely get sick. So Im not sure if maybe being deficient in some areas like vitamin D or zinc is why my body doesnt fight off HPV as well as other people? I know the body is supposed to clear within 2 years, but given my wart history, Im not sure I fall into that bucket.   I guess my question is, would Gardasil 9 even be worth it at this point? I read some studies done that although Gardasil 9 doesnt target the common, plantar, plane, etc. warts, it could actually be used as a treatment option as some individuals noticed clearance after getting the vaccine.   I just hate these things and now that one popped up on my tongue, Im freaked out and feeling low self-esteem. I truly believe building immunity is key to fighting many illnesses, so willing to give anything a go. Have any of you experienced wart clearance after the vaccine?

Major paranoia about oral,"Hi, everyone! So I've been really paranoid lately, and I feel stupid asking questions sometimes because I can't tell if I need to be concerned or if I'm just paranoid.  I 24F am a virgin, so I've never had intercourse. I got my first serious boyfriend a few months ago, and I've been navigating new experiences with him. All we've done is oral sex to each other however, I found out about STD's being transmitted through any form of sexual contact. I asked him to get tested, but he got a little offended, so I just went ahead and got tested. Neither of us have shown any signs of an STD, but my anxiety and paranoia drove me insane, so I wanted to get that peace of mind. The test was a vaginal swab, so I don't think it covered all STD's, but it came back negative, and the NP even reassured me at the office that chances of me getting an STD from oral sex alone is really low, and that I'd have some sort of signs or symptoms.  It's been a few months since then, and I'm not with that boyfriend anymore. Everything was fine, until I started getting hemorrhoids here and there recently. I'm almost positive they're hemorrhoids since they react to my hemorrhoid cream, but they're mostly painless, just really uncomfortable especially with friction from my underwear. I'm spiraling now because I'm scared they're anal warts or they're signs of HPV. I forgot what tests the vaginal swab covered when I got tested, but I'm pretty sure it was chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and herpes? I'm freaking out now and riddled with anxiety because what if I have HPV? Of course, I looked to Google, and the facts I read are just driving me crazier. I got the HPV vaccine and all necessary vaccines when I was younger, but I'm still so paranoid. Should I get tested again and get a blood test?   I'm all alone with this, and I come from a very conservative family, so this is very new to me, and the stuff I read online only seems to freak me out even more.

Possible Exposure after BJ from escort. Freaking out.,"Hi there. I hope whoever reading this is well. So about 11 days ago I received a covered blowjob from a sex worker and after I came inside the condom, I cleaned up but when I was showering afterwards in her bathroom, I saw cream for genital warts and at that point I knew I had fucked up because while she was sucking me, she was adamant that she doesnt want to take off her shorts and it all clicked. I know it doesnt help but 3 days after I got the HPV vaccine shot but what Im really scared of is HIV because I read online - im not sure if its true - that most people with HIV have HPV too. Its been 11 days and Ive got a sore throat for about 2 days, a rash on the left side of my head even though Im not sure its just razor bumps from shaving my head a few days back and a small pimple on my underarm which Im not sure is a swollen lymph node. Other than that everything is normal but Im freaking out that I couldve caught HIV. I know a covered blow is generally safe from HIV but Im worried that there might have been a tear in the condom or something. Thank you in advance for your response.","{'labels': ['gratitude'], 'scores': [0.7609994411468506]}"

What is and is not rape?,"I am a 38 year old male. I got with a girl in early 2004. I had a little smell for like a day, but it went away and did not think anything of it. Then I got with a different girl in the spring. She said she had had an irregular pap before I got with her. That girl and I lived together for the summer. While I was living with her I noticed a small red bump on my pubic line that looked like a pimple. I did not think anything of it. The girl went away to Europe for the fall semester. While she was gone the red bump turned into a small wart at my pubic line. I got the wart removed. I went to visit her in Europe and did not tell her because the wart was at my waist and I did not know if it was genital HPV or not, she had already been exposed from sex that spring and summer, and I did not want to ruin her time in Europe that semester. This was 18 years ago and I still do not know if she was with anybody else in Europe. She returned to the United States and I was going to visit her at her college in 2005. The wart returned and I went to get it removed and the nurse put too much TCA acid on my waist and it burned the skin around the wart and left a scab. I went to visit her at her college and I guess I guess I was thinking it was the last I would be seeing of her for a while and told her the scab was from an iron and we had sex. One night the condom broke and she got the morning after pill. Our next sexual experience she asked if I wanted to have sex without a condom and we did. A couple months later a wart appeared at the base of my penis and I told her and she was nice. We went to a concert together later that year. Then I did not see her for two years and went I did see her we kissed and cuddled. Then I visited her later in the year and we had sex again in 2007. I had wrote about this in my online biography and nobody said anything then she started trying to have my whole city say the sex with the scab was rape. She consented to the sex and I am just some guy who wishes the best for all living things dealing with something from 18 years ago.  In 2006 I 69ed with a girl at a party without telling her I had had a wart on my pubic line and at the base of my penis. We then had sex another night. Then we had sex in the morning. We wore condoms for the vaginal sex. I did not say anything to her about the HPV because I thought my body was clear of whatever I had. She is now calling me a rapist.  That girl heard I had sex with a girl in the bathroom of a hotel type place I was working front desk at in 2007when I started sucking on the girls tits in the bathroom while I was working and she asked 'Are you doing your job?' I said I was working and she replied 'If you were doing your job you would get a condom.', so I got a condom and she placed herself on top of on my dick and rode for a while then I did her missionary style. The girl returned the next year to go camping with me but I was paranoid I was getting something and just cuddled with her instead of having sex. I did not tell her about the HPV because I thought my body was clear of whatever I had. Now people in my city are saying it was rape.  I had a wart on my waist in 2004 and on the base of my penis in 2005. I did not have anything for 16 years then I started smoking a lot of cigarettes and had an anal biopsy of something in 2021 that ended up being a wart. Then after smoking more cigarettes I had red bumps appear on the membrane of my penis. I went to the doctor and got Aldera to put on my body and the bumps went away. I have not had anything for around 1 year 6 months.  I have had 2 of 3 HPV vaccine injections. Planned Parenthood stopped taking my insurance and I went to a regular doctor asking for the 3rd injection and he told me I am too old for the HPV vaccine.","{'labels': ['neutral'], 'scores': [0.9666972160339355]}"

Thoughts on knowingly contracting HPV,"Just looking for some opinions, maybe from people who have had HPV in the past. I 23M have been seeing this girl 24F and we got to the point where we were going to have sex. She told me she recently found out she has HPV, even though she was vaccinated at 15, and it's a genital warts type. I told her I just wanted to research a little before we had sex which she completely understood.  I really like her a lot and REALLY want to have sex with her, but I'm worried about HPV even though it's apparently not a big deal especially since this strain doesn't cause cancer. I got my HPV vaccine at 12 y/o but since this strain got through her vaccine I figure there's a good chance it gets through mine too. I think this is pretty casual so there's a good chance we don't date for long, meaning I might move on to other partners within the next couple of years before any infection would have the time needed to clear. So I'm in the awkward position of deciding whether to get/risk getting HPV in order to have sex with this person I very much like. I guess I'm worried about what effects HPV may have on my future sexual relationships?  Do people have opinions on this? Especially to more experienced folks, if someone tells you they have HPV before sex, how do you react? Should I just ignore it and move on? Or try to avoid sex? I know condoms exist but since they are known to not be super effective against HPV I consider them risky too.

The CDC page on autism and vaccines is a disgrace.,"The CDC claims that ""Vaccines do not cause autism"". On its ""Autism and Vaccines"" page it lists 2 studies to backup this statement   Adverse Effects of Vaccines Evidence and Causality Institute of Medicine. 2012   Increasing exposure to antibody-stimulating proteins and polysaccharides in vaccines is not associated with risk of autism J Pediatr. 2013  The 2nd is concerned with the link between antigen levels and autism but doesn't look at safety for vaccines in general including all their ingredients so we can ignore it here.  The first link is the 2012 Institute of Medicine's ""Adverse Effects of Vaccines Evidence and Causality"" which was tasked with reviewing all the medical literature concerning a list of adverse events see Table 1-1 and eight vaccines MMR, Varicella, Influenza, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, HPV, DTaP, Meningococcal to see if a link could be proven or disproven.  So what did they find for autism?  You can search the report for ""autism"" and these are the results  Vaccine ChapterAutism ""hits""                        --                                  MMR84 Varicella0 Influenza0 Hepatitis A0 Hepatitis B0 HPV0 DTaP7 Meningococcal0  Interesting, for 6 of the 8 vaccines, they found no studies that investigated a link between the vaccine and autism. So right there, we have a major problem because the CDC is using this IOM review to state that ""vaccines do not cause autism"", yet they could find no autism studies for 6 of them.  It gets worse. What did they find for DTaP? They found 1 study, Geier and Geier which actually did find a link, but the IOM rejected it ""because it provided data from a passive surveillance system and lacked an unvaccinated comparison population."" This is ironic when you consider that HHS and CDC have never performed a vaxxed/unvaxxed study and that the ""passive surveillance system"" they used was VAERS.  In any case, having thrown out this study, the conclusion for DTaP matches the conclusion for the other 6 vaccines for which no autism studies could be found  The epidemiologic evidence is insufficient or absent to assess an association between diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, or acellular pertussiscontaining vaccine and autism.  In other words, the CDC is attempting to use a study review which found ZERO studies regarding a link with autism for 7 of the 8 vaccines looked at, to prove that ""vaccines do not cause autism"".  Now in case there is any doubt about what the IOM review is saying, they further address this in the Concluding Comments  An issue that is likely to be of concern to some readers regards the very stringent approach our committee has taken. For the majority of adverse events the committee was asked to examine, the committee concludes that the evidence is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship. Some might interpret that to mean either of the following statements    Because the committee did not find convincing evidence that the vaccine does cause the adverse event, the vaccine is safe.    Because the committee did not find convincing evidence that the vaccine does not cause the adverse event, the vaccine is unsafe.  Neither of these interpretations is correct. Inadequate to accept or reject means just thatinadequate.  So the CDC is doing exactly what the IOM is cautioning against regarding a link between vaccines and autism - they are trying to pass off absence of evidence as evidence of absence.  This is not acceptable, and demonstrates that the CDC is engaged in pseudo-science when it comes to the link between vaccines and autism.  And in case there is any doubt, ICAN FOIA'd the CDC for all studies that they rely upon to claim that ""vaccines do not cause autism"" for the vaccines on the first 6 months of the CDC schedule and the CDC came back with nothing they just listed MMR and thimerosol studies - the MMR is not given in the 1st 6 months.","{'labels': ['neutral'], 'scores': [0.9783520698547363]}"

"Wart therapy with intralesional Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccination MMR vaccine","BACKGROUND  The purpose of the study was to examine the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccination, which is used to cure warts.  METHODS  The research comprised 53 individuals of various ages who had one or more warts, whether they were single or numerous. Three times, at intervals of three weeks, the patients received 0.5 ml of  intralesional MMR vaccination into a single wart or the biggest wart in the event of numerous lesions. Every two months for up to six months after treatment, all patients were checked for relapses. The effectiveness of the treatment and its adverse effects were assessed.  RESULTS   50 of the 53 patients who participated in the trial finished it. 36 72 of the patients had a complete reaction, whereas 9 18 showed a partial response, and 5 10 showed no response. Three of the 36 patients who had a full response had warts come back. The primary negative effects that were noticed were pain at the injection site and symptoms of the flu.  CONCLUSIONS   Intralesional immunotherapy with the MMR vaccination was discovered to be a straightforward, reliable, and secure method of treating warts. Since patients may be treated with only three doses of the MMR vaccination given at intervals of three weeks, this trial has shown to be cost-effective.  From the article  Recurrence of warts was observed in 3 8.3 out of 50 patients in the current research who had had a full response, which corresponded to a 2.7 recurrence rate. 19 This was in  contradiction to other earlier investigations that found no relapse to have occurred. 20, 21 In previous research, 2 of patients who got mumps antiserum had a recurrence. 22  Source    PDF file","{'labels': ['neutral'], 'scores': [0.9986957907676697]}"

Read this,"HPV is probably the most uncertain virus where nobody can tell exactly what can happen  It might clear from your body or it might not  It can cause cancer or it wont   Warts can reappear even after 10 years or it might never  It can spread to others even after 2 years even with condoms even after vaccination or it might not  It can be immune suppressed and can come back when you are sick or your immune system can completely eliminate it  You can tell your partner or you dont have to  Ufff! Uncertainty is at the best  There is no right way to go about it,  Let me ask you a question?  are you 100 sure youre gonna be alive 5 years from now?  No, no one can be sure   but still you assume the positive probability and plan the future isnt it?  And you try your best to keep yourself safe from harm  So do same with the hpv  Assume the positive probability and increase your luck by keeping yourself healthy and fit and focusing on quality relationship  Maybe its affecting your confidence? Its mental block so take this as an opportunity to grow as a stronger person   What if they reject you? Disclosure is a choice after clearance for more than 6 months and if you want to disclose do disclose with the proper facts and confidently  you want to be with someone who accepts for who you are with all your good and bad and if someone doesnt want to be with you thats fine almost half the population is your opposite gender  Take this opportunity to find someone who likes you for you","{'labels': ['caring', 'curiosity'], 'scores': [0.9821423888206482, 0.36764535307884216]}"
Most likely genital warts but maybe its something less scary?,"Imgur link to photo  24F, south Asian, straight woman. Im convinced these are GW but maybe someone can tell me theyre not.

Honestly I forget about them for most of the day until nighttime when I have time to think.   I did get the HPV vaccine in grade 7 via two doses, per Ontario guidelines. I also likely have a bartholin cyst, on labia on the same side. Smaller than a golf ball, not painful at all, doesnt impact my day-to-day so I pretty much forget about its existence all the time.

Hpv disclosure,"Friends, This is awkward to me but I36m want to address this properly. Sorry for the longer story but I feel the background is important. Over 15 years ago I was donating plasma and my plasma was rejected upon testing because there was a non conclusive flag for HIV. only had one partner up to that pointwe were no longer together but sex was almost exclusively non-protected. I went in for extensive testing and they confirmed that it was not HIV. However there were markers for HPV. As a male I was never vaccinated against this for some reason. Over the years I have had several very small warts that have been dealt with and I haven't had one for over a year. This testing took place nearly 10 years ago while I was dating my soon to be wife. She was in the loop and vaccinated so no big deal.   Fast forward to today. My 12 year relationship with my wife 5 of those married is in the divorce stage a year after seperation when I discovered that she was seeing someone else out of nowhere. It has been a really hard year for me, but I have done the work and am in probably the best mental/physical/emotional health of my life. A female in my circle also just finalized a divorce under very similar circumstances and we have been talking to eachother alot for support. At this point we have both basically admitted to being confused and scared but that we feel something for the eachother. We agreed to just let it flow and see what happens and things have been escalating rapidly. It's only a matter of time before this turns physical I feel.   Not telling her is not an option as our entire interaction up to this point has refreshingly been entirely open and honest. I just have no idea how or when to bring this up. In the heat of the moment is not ideal seems like it would wreck that raw passion, but bringing it up before we get physical also feels presumptuous. Knowing her this is not a deal breaker, especially if she is vaccinated as most females are. Wondering if anyone else has experience with this sort of disclosure. Thank you for your time.","{'labels': ['gratitude'], 'scores': [0.7754644751548767]}"

Edit3 its a skin tag looking growth of skin and two small bumps in a line near it, flesh coloured and not painful, so not a wart unless diagnosed, it doesnt look like one, but rather odd to develop a skin tag on your penis, hence the MAY have one    Okay I understand this is somewhat of a medical question however Im not looking for medical advice, just really contradicting information when I tried to look this up.   Partner and I were exclusive a year ago then broke up, got back together about 3 times and in between those times in the last year both of us got involved with 2-3 people, unprotected. We havent met in a while, but he tells me he has a genital wart that looks like a skin tag and it popped up a month ago, with two more flesh coloured, painless bumps. He tries to be sensible and so do I, last time we met we both had had tests and were clear, however he has been with one or two people, over a month ago.   I said he should get checked to which he said warts if its one dont come from the cancerous strain of HPV. So just wait and see because if its HPV theres nothing that can be done, if it isnt im wasting someones time over a skin tag that will eventually fall off.  From my research though, they are highly contagious and may or may not turn out to be a health concern at some point.   Seems that if we had sex, even protected, it would be contagious to genitals and mouth. Does that mean if its a hpv strain hes sort of doomed with transferring that for the rest of his life, and if I were to get contaminated, highly likely would develop warts and most certainly catch given strain of hpv?and then also be doomed for the rest of my life with potentially passing it on?

How do normal people function, kissing who they like, having sex with who they like. Im so fearful of catching something that its preventing me from getting into a relationship of any kind. Ive even given up the effort of starting a conversation because I know where itll go or wont go. Its pretty depressing to be honest and not doing much for my morale and overall mental state. I suffer with health anxiety, which has improved over the years but not with this. How can I move forward. Any advice would be welcome. Thanks.","{'labels': ['fear', 'gratitude'], 'scores': [0.8111807107925415, 0.8785620331764221]}"
How Do I Get Out Of My Own Head?,"Whenever I masturbate, I cant stop overthinking and have trouble relaxing. I cant focus on how Im feeling. Its like my thoughts are exploding out of a box and scattering. Ive tried meditation but it didnt work.   Also, after Im done, I start feeling intense shame and I get depressed for a while longest was 2 hours. I just feel gross afterwards. I think its because my mom has told me multiple times that sex is for after marriage, shames women who have slept with multiple people and prostitutes, and said that the I dont need to get the HPV vaccine anytime soon since Im not a hoochie. My dad also sexualizes me sometimes by saying my clothes show my body too much even when Im wearing leggings and a tank top. He hides that behavior by saying hes protecting me from men and that he knows how they think. My parents also touched me without my consent through my childhood so I have body issues.

"Looking for advice and guidance when it comes to sex, HPV, and new long term partner","Just as the title suggests, Im looking for advice and guidance on how to navigate my 24F partner 27M and Is sexual relationship when one of us has HPV and has most likely passed it to the other.  This is not my first rodeo with HPV unfortunately, high risk. While a colposcopy isnt unfamiliar and knowing HPV is very common, I feel the need to reevaluate how to approach the sex life with my new long term partner because 1 its most likely Ive passed it to him and that brings feelings of shame and 2 the thought of how to navigate sex while trying to clear HPV is a lot.  My parter is aware of whats going on and is very supportive and understanding, and reassuring that things will be okay. Ive told him they detected LSIL, that I need another colposcopy, and that Im worried about it turning into cancer. It was most likely passed from someone who I slept with in 2022, before we started dating long term  That said, reevaluating our sex life Im capable of abstinence as an old pap came up negative the year I did that, but Im not sure how that would look for us since having sex does help with our emotional closeness. We recently started using condoms because I expressed interest and hes on the same page about using them moving forward for safety purposes. Are there ways we can approach sex differently that is mindful of HPV? If so, what are they? Ive thought masturbating together yet individually might be an option as its still achieving the emotional closeness relationships need while taking an abstinence approach. Of course, I will talk to my partner about my concerns and will see what works for us. Suggestions will at least help set a base.","{'labels': ['nervousness', 'realization'], 'scores': [0.3567330837249756, 0.3850654661655426]}"

Scared of getting tested because of past experience and its affecting my future.,"TW for mentions of SA. When IF19 was 16 I got my first boyfriendM18 and I had my first kiss with him and all we really did was kiss but he wanted to move on to more intimate acts. I was young and dumb and got manipulated into a sexually controlling relationship. Before I would agree to more intimate acts though, I asked him questions such as  When and how he lost his virginity.   Whens the last time he had been tested.  Do you have condoms/dental dams.  He lost his virginity to an older woman who assaulted him when he was 12 and repeatedly assaulted him afterwards. When I was talking to him about it he didnt see anything wrong or feel like it was a consent and assault issue. He was proud in fact that a woman would want him so young. Looking back he may have repressed it as a bad memory.   When I asked him on a separate occasion when he had last been tested and said I didnt feel really comfortable moving on to more sexual acts unless we got tested his reaction was anger and I quote Do you think Im unclean?I tried explaining it wasnt about but more about our safety and peace of mind but he refused to talk about it. I also was worried but didnt mention that a woman who was willing to rape a child may not have the best sexual health and he may have an STD with no symptoms.   Throughout the relationship he broke multiple sexual boundaries and would use him being upset as a way to gain sexual favors from me.  So when he would want more I would just stall until either of us had to go. Here is why I am afraid to get tested. One time he wanted me to give him oral and I was very reluctant. I said I didnt really want to and that I would only do it with a a condom. He gave me some bullshit about tight condoms and how youre not supposed to do it that way. He said if I didnt he would get in my face and make me suck it and he did. His precum and got in my mouth and Ive been scared to get STD since. I also found out he was cheating on me which added to my stress of testing.   At the time I couldnt tell my parents my concerns because of religious and purity culture beliefs. Im 19 now and reliant on my parents for transportation and insurance and still cannot get tested. My mom also hand picked my gynecologist and all of my information goes out to her. My parents are also anti vax and dont necessarily believe in getting vaccinated against HPV but it has been a big concern of mine.   I also am extremely concerned about what the results would say and how I would navigate my life only having had that one sexual encounter and possibly having an incurable STD. I have had no symptoms that I think are consistent with STI/STDs but my sexual education isnt the best and I could be asymptomatic.

Pap smear and HPV results- Im confused,"  Sorry for this long post, but my brain is a jumbled mess and I couldnt find answers specific to my questions. I do plan to talk to my doctor asap, but my results just came in yesterday, so I havent had a chance yet. And I am admittedly panicking a little. I know statistically speaking its likely to clear, but I am scared and also confused.   My Pap smear results from 2/23/24 stated the following  LOW-GRADE SQUAMOUS INTRAEPITHELIAL LESION LSIL ENCOMPASSING HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS /MILD DYSPLASIA/CIN1.   My HPV Atima test was negative. I was reading that this test only detects the 14 high risk strains they know of though.   The doc also had a vaginal pathogen test done. It came back last week showing it detected gardnerella vaginalis at a slightly higher level than normal range normal is less than 2,000, and mine was less than 10,000. She said this was fine because I had enough healthy bacteria to rebalance without antibiotics.   I tested for the other standard STIs at 3 months after my last partner, and again at 6 months and everything was negative.   I had two sexual partners early last year, but prior to that I was in a monogamous relationship for 20 years. I have a new partner now and we have been seeing each other for 1 month and only had protected sex I know with HPV this doesnt matter sometimes.   I am 38 and have been getting pap smears since I was 25. I have not had an abnormal result until now. I got the original gardisil vaccines when they first came out in my early twenties, but did not get the updated ones. My last normal pap was February 2022.   So my questions are  1. Is this result most likely stating that I have a LOW risk HPV that is causing my abnormal pap? And its just not showing on the HPV test?   2. Is it still possible I do actually have a HIGH risk HPV, but its not detected yet, even though I already have abnormal cells?   3. Could slight overgrowth of gardnerella cause the abnormal result? I did have BV twice last year, but both times it was resolved with antibiotics and gardnerella was not one of the things detected at that time.   4. If I do have HPV then should I stop having sex with my current partner completely until it is resolved?  5. What else could potentially cause an abnormal result if it is not HPV or BV/yeast infection?

I'm seeing a therapist but my insurance kinda sucks so I can only talk to her once every other week and I've only had one session so far. I really struggle to talk about this stuff in person. My heart's racing just from writing about it.   I really want to have a satisfying sex life and I'm 33 and feel like I'm running out of time I know that's kinda irrational but it is how I feel, like I wasted my 20s. I waffle between just having a casual fling to get comfortable with sex again or trying to find someone I really trust and care about so that I feel safer, but then that's more pressure and will take longer to find. Should I tell any potential future partners about my lengthy celibacy or is it too much of a red flag? I know I'm going to be incredibly inexperienced and awkward and at 33 I think people would expect a little more than what I'm probably capable of. Any advise from people who had similar experiences?  I should also ad that part of the reason I gave up sex was testing positive for HPV, which really freaked me out. I've tested negative for years and I got the vaccine, but now I'm very anxious about STIs. Even when I kissed that one person, I was paranoid that he gave me HSV and methodically checked my lips for months I know it's super common and don't wanna add to the overhyped stigma, but I'm sort of a hypochondriac.

What on earth is wrong with the doctors here? Needing some support.,"I've been struggling with warts for about 7 years now and I go through bouts of extreme depression because of it, today is one of those days. I've had two therapists during this time that I both really liked but they had absolutely nothing helpful to say regarding this topic since it's a very legitimate worry of mine that dating and hooking up is infinately harder for me now unless I simply don't disclose.  Anyways, I feel like all the doctors I have seen so far dermatologists, obgyns, one proctologist just don't give a single fuck.  I've been told by one doctors that they see no warts even though there were clearly there so I was sent home without any treatment, another one said that since I've tried different approaches already there's nothing she can do for me. I've also gotten them lasered off and treated with acid but those three times they never get all of them so I go under anesthisia and/or pay for nothing basically.   One thing I haven't tried yet is getting the vaccine that the doctors try to sell me but is that even something that legitimately can make warts go away? Never heard of another type of active infection that can be treated by getting vaxxed for it.   Sorry for being so whiney about this but I'm honestly losing it. I can't imagine to live like this forever.  ","{'labels': ['fear', 'nervousness'], 'scores': [0.4167516827583313, 0.8757271766662598]}"

safer sex options with HPV,"Hi all, Im male 27. Ive recently start seeing someone and spend a night with her.

I dont mind it too much because as a man Ive most likely been in contact with an HPV before in my life. Never had visible symptoms.  She was given a cream treatment, and my understanding is that she should not have sex during the treatment which I understand as no penetrative sex protected or not, and no oral sex on her, but maybe I am wrong  We discussed about it and still want to see each other.

I really need support,"I really need some encouragement, after todays visit Im pretty depressed. Ive just found a wart deep in my meatus and Im already afraid of the recurrence.  To be clear, english is not my language, sorry for the mistakes. M26, gay, Im struggling with warts for more than 2 years and they keep on appearing.  It all started 2,5 years ago while I was in a monogamous relationship still doubts about been cheated I had only 2-3 warts of few millimeters, on my glands, but they kept on appearing, each time after few days from any kind of treatment laser, cryotherapy, Imiquimod. This situation lasted more than a year and a half and so I kept on going to the clinics every few weeks for more than a year. It was exhausting.. Finally I decided to do the vaccine and for 9 months I was completely clear! During this period, I broke up with my boyfriend. This last until this november, when I found a small wart. By the way it started to reduced by itself and with only a session of cryo, the wart disappears and I remained clear for the last few months.  So, finally confindent and feeling safe, I started dating again and in the last week I also received unprotected oral sex.  So, what its the problem? That today I went to a check up, feeling safe and happy and instead they found me a wart of 5 mm, deep in my meatus that I didnt notice at all its inside the meatus. And so now I need to wait another month in order to have a surgery to remove it I really dont know what to think, I tried every treatment, its already 2 years and a half and I dont see any end at all. Now I also have to tell the guy Im dating about the thing, I feel guilty, but I after months being clear I didnt image this..hopefully I didnt expose him to high risk, the wart being internal.

passing hpv back to each other?,"Hi everyone, I had my first Pap smear last year a couple of months before my 25th birthday. It came back abnormal so had to go for a colposcopy where they took a biopsy, it showed only cin1 abnormalities so they didnt recommend treatment but instead told me to come back in a year for another colposcopy which will be in October.  I did actually have all three of my hpv vaccines the four strain one between ages 16-17 all before I became sexually active in any form. I know that I got this from my boyfriend of 6 years as I have only ever been with him. He did have a bout of warts during our relationship which he had frozen off, Ive never had any warts, but he obviously had another higher risk strain as well which I have caught. Im not overly upset as I understand it is something that can be out of peoples control.  Im quite healthy but have been more health focused since I found out as I dont want it to progress and Id quite like to fight it off. Ive been trying to eat healthy, exercising and getting enough sleep etc. I dont smoke / vape or drink heavily. I also recently changed bc from the pill to iud as I read somewhere that the iud insertion can trigger some sort of immune response in the cervix or something Id also been on the pill for over 6 years and wanted to try something different due to lower libido etc  I guess I just want to ask, if I continue to have unprotected sex with my boyfriend will this delay / prevent me from clearing the infection?

HPV journey at 20 years old,"Im 20 years old and Ive had warts on my elbows, knees, feet and hand sense I was around 8. As I got older they popped up more and more. One seems to have popped up on my penis and I got very scared and did some research learning what warts really are. It was crazy to me that I struggled with this at such a young age and my parents never got it taken care of but thats in past and we cant dwell on that. So  I went straight to a dermatologist and got it checked out. I was very concerned I got a STD/STI but according to my DR that isnt the case. See google and all these other online sources will tell you Genital Warts are caused by sexual skin to skin contact and thats the way you can get them. My dr said sense Ive had my warts for so many years and had one on my head its very likely that mine is just from my own skin to skin contact. Even if it was a STI/STD wart from HPV your dr can still take care of it for you. Dont think you life is over and youll never find someone. My gf and I have been together for around a year and this wart recently popped up and she is supportive and staying with me. Sex isnt everything remember that.

Can I have sex? Getting It On with HPV,"Disclaimers  Before, we begin, if you're wondering about oral sex, please see my post here for more details on oral specifically   This post will focus on penis in vagina or penis in anus sex. I know that is a slightly narrow definition of sex I think my oral post will cover lots of scenarios for wlw. When it comes to vaginas rubbing on vaginas, I think a lot of the same principles as penis in vagina will apply.   Addiitonally - for shorthand, I am referring to men and women in this post. Please understand that 'men' also encompasses 'people with penises' who may identify as other than men, and 'women' also encompasses 'people with cervixes' and/or 'people with vaginas' who may identify as other than women. I hope you will give me some grace here in not typing these out in full each time, and understand that I am referring to a very generalised and basic biology here for the sake of brevity and getting the point across.   I am Not A Doctor. I have had both high and low risk HPV, the latter of which gave me GW for 2.5 years, and I am now 18 months wart free. I have researched extensively, and spent a lot of time on this forum helping people since my diagnosis. With that said, I am open to correction if you can cite your sources.   On some points, HPV science is unclear or still developing, leaving us to make our own conclusions. My conclusions do not have to be your conclusions.   So, with that said  Help! I've got HPV! Can I have sex?  The short answer is...yes, of course you can have sex.  Let's consider this from a couple of different angles, based on posts we regularly see here on r/hpv.  I've just got my smear results back and I've got a high risk cervical infection. I'm devastated. Can I have sex with my regular partner?  Having a cervical infection at some point in your life is pretty normal Although it can feel like a lot to process to hear that you have 'an STD', let's not forget that genital HPV is pretty hard to avoid, considering that a large  of people have an active infection at any one time, condoms don't fully prevent transmission, most infections are asymptomatic, testing is not commonly done for men in most places and where it is, it's usually not reliable, and only done for women every few years/on one tiny body part/usually only for a few strains. Additionally, it's possible for old infections to reactivate after time, so you can easily have a positive result after years of monogamy.   So in this way, HPV is not like a lot of other STDs, like chlamydia or gonorrhoea, for example. It's something that we are very, very, very likely to have at some point in our lives and we can't do very much about that besides living in a polythene bubble, which personally doesn't sound like fun.   If you have a regular partner fuck buddy, boyfriend, submissive slave, wild love affair... then there is a high chance that you already share the infection. They may have already given it to you.   See this study that shows that 68 of heterosexual couples had anogenital HPV type concordance i.e. they had the same type at the same time another study showing 64-95 concordance over short time spans - although this might just be DNA transfer and not necessarily established infection concordance of at least one HPV type in 57 of couples - and in those couples, 85 of the men had the same high risk type as the woman.   Interestingly, these studies also show that couples can have different strains independent of each other, which just goes to show...everyone you meet has their own strains and can give you a new type...yay.   Anyway, this isn't about blame. It's usually not possible to know if they gave it to you, or you gave it to them unless one of you came from a monastery, and even then, a small  of virgins are found to carry genital HPV. And it's actually not important. This is not an infection like chlamydia where we need to or can trace the chain of infection and then treat people. HPV is literally everywhere, and in most cases there is nothing we can do about it. And most infections pass without causing harm.  So, seeing as you very likely already share the infection with a regular partner, there's no reason to stop having sex.   Of course, if you feel negative about sex then by all means take a break. But for purely biological reasons, there is no reason to stop.   Won't my boyfriend just reinfect me?  With an infection like chlamydia, if you take your antibiotics but your boyfriend doesn't, then yes, when you have sex with your infected partner, you will just catch chlamydia again.   HPV doesn't quite work like that. We have the viral infection in our bodies already, and it's active for some time. Think about it like you have a cold and your partner has a cold...when you kiss them, you're not catching the cold again. You've both already got it.   Eventually, your body will suppress the infection is likely to produce antibodies so you're unlikely to 'recatch' the same type from your partner if they haven't also suppressed their infection.   There is a caveat here that it seems to be harder for men's bodies to seroconvert and get natural immunity. This can leave them open to more infections with the same type. If your strain is a vaccine strain then getting vaccinated could potentially support his body with this process.   Should we be using condoms?  Given that you probably share your infection, isn't it a waste of time to use condoms?  No. Studies show that using condoms helps promote the regression of cervical abnormalities This is probably because it lowers the viral load being rubbed around so there's less for the body to deal with.   Obviously, this is your personal choice and not a hard and fast rule, but it is something that's shown to help.   What about oral?  See my post above.   I don't have a regular partner but I'm thinking about dating again. Having a high risk cervical infection makes me scared to date.   First off - everything I wrote above still applies. Having HPV is extremely normal For this reason, it's absolutely not a reason not to date. If you are on the younger side, a LOT of people you meet will already have their own HPV infection - but they might not know now, or ever know.   See     Essentially, Karen continues The only way to not get HPV or pass on HPV is to refrain from any type of sexual contact, which isnt realistic for most people, which is why an estimated 80 of us are likely to get it in our lifetimes.   So, is it considered safe to have sex if you have HPV? In short, yes.   Our immune system is designed to get rid of HPV, like it does with colds, for example, explains Karen  Do I need to disclose my high risk infection to new partners before we have sex?  Many doctors say you do not need to disclose. Why? Your partner will probably never know, and it's not likely to cause them harm. See Jo's Trust and the British Medical Journal as two sources that support this view.   However, on this Reddit, we lean towards disclosure. Why? We see the fallout when things go wrong, for one. And secondly, I personally think it's good to be honest with people and it encourages honesty from them like are they getting tested for the testable things? Do they have oral herpes? Are they shagging anyone else right now? etc..   But, once you test negative, there is no need to disclose, unless you want to be able to discuss it on a relationship level.   TLDR high risk cervical infection yes, you can have sex. You should probably tell your partner. You should probably use condoms. You should probably both get vaccinated. It's very normal.  Okay, but I have genital warts.  This is a bit more of a nuanced situation.   Most medical advice is not to have sex with visible warts. Why? Warts are very contagious so it's easy to pass on the HPV virus to your partner, especially when there are the warts on the skin.   If you have a regular partner, however, the above regarding shared infection still holds true. They may well share your infection already unless vaccinated against your type. They may or may not ever develop visible warts themselves.   So, in this situation, it needs to be a discussion between you. Perhaps you are happy to continue your regular sex life in the knowledge that you probably already have that infection or you're vaccinated against it. Perhaps you decide to wait until you have removed your warts and gone for a few months without regrowths, in order to ensure the lowest viral load possible. Perhaps you decide to wait until one or both parties are fully vaccinated.  Certainly, using condoms seems to make the duration of warts shorter. You might also want to factor in that wart treatment can be painful, and sex might be sore some wart treatment like Aldara doesn't play nicely with condoms and traumatising the skin can give rise to more warts while your infection is active which is why you shouldn't shave while you have warts.   If you have a new partner, you should definitely let them know that you have visible warts, and make that decision together. Again, perhaps you decide to wait until both parties are vaccinated perhaps you decide to wait until a few months post your last wart or perhaps you decide to go for it.   On a personal level, I did have sex with visible warts. Why? My warts hung around for 2.5 years. I was celibate for 14 months of this time, which believe me was enough. I didn't want to waste my last fertile years which actually had already gone, unbeknownst to me, but anyway and I didn't want to be lonely and miserable. So, I started dating again, and disclosed to people once I got to know them. It was their choice to have sex, and to my knowledge none of them developed visible warts although they may of course have the virus asymptomatically - or indeed have other strains not connected to me!.   What about when my warts are gone? When you remove warts, your infection can still be active. Annoyingly, we don't currently have a way to know when it stops being active. There are different schools of thought on this, but you can reasonably assume that once your warts stop growing back, and you've gone a few months without them, you've probably immune suppressed. 90 of infections are suppressed within two years but the median is much lower loads of studies on this but here's one on men, for example   We actually don't know the details of HPV transmission after immune suppression, but it's likely to be much lower or even zero logically, when we think about an inactive or undetectable infection. Given that seroprevalence in the population shows that a decent chunk of people have had wart strains e.g. around 20 seroprevalence for HPV 6 in Germany  not even taking into account all the other strains that can cause warts then there are a lot of past infections out there. You are now a pretty normal human being who has a past HPV infection.   Whether you want to disclose this or not is up to you and how you feel about your relationship and discussing this kind of thing.   I'm never having sex again because I can't be responsible for giving someone cancer or warts, and I need HPV to stop with me.   If you are not comfortable dating or having sex, that is fine. If you never date again and you're happy like this, cool. If you want to date again but you need time to heal and have therapy, that's a good idea. Dating can be hard with or without HPV and you need a thick skin and a lot of self love.   However.   You having HPV does not cause cancer for other people. If someone is sexually active then they WILL come across HPV in their lifetime, from you or from anyone else they interact with. And in most cases that infection will just pass. If someone gets cancer many years or decades down the line THAT IS NOT YOUR FAULT - it is a quirk of their immune system that absolutely sucks, but, like - you did not directly cause that.  I could kiss someone tomorrow and get Covid and then get long Covid and not get out of bed for the next 10 years. Is that their fault?  My aunt could have kissed me on the cheek in 1997 and given me HSV1 which develops into Alzheimers in 20 years time. Is that their fault?  I could lick someone's butthole tomorrow and get H Pylori that develops into a stomach ulcer and I have to go to hospital. Is that their fault?  Etc. Etc. Etc.   One could say, well, Spanakopita, you are going around kissing people so you are part of this big chain of bugs and diseases and infections!!! To which I say - personally, I cannot live in a bubble. I like kissing people. I like fucking people. I like falling in love and I want to be in a relationship which in my culture means I need to go on some dates and probably breathe on someone at some point. And yes, rub mucosal membranes.  I used to take a huge burden on myself, but when I started dating again, I realised that people I date take risks ALL the time, some of them highly stupid hands up if you've been stealthed...yeah, me too. Most of the time, even though I know I have had HPV, I am WAY down on the list of risks those people take.    HPV is like grains of sand on a beach. We are not going to eradicate it. We are vastly reducing the risks of cancer from HPV through vaccination woohoo but we cannot at this point in time remove the 30 types not covered by vaccination from the population. So me not having sex really wouldn't make any difference to the situation.  What is more important to me these days is the risk I take. I do take the risk of having sex, because it's important to me, personally. I lower that risk by getting to know people and making sure that a they are cool and b the sex is gonna be fire, getting tested regularly for the testable stuff and asking partners for tests, having a frank sexual health chat before we get to it, and using condoms with new partners to protect myself against the big hitters. Also, I'm vaccinated with Gardasil and get my smears and a dental check done regularly. None of that negates the risks of sex, but it does mean that I've done my due diligence. I know that I might get a new strain of HPV from a new partner. But would I want that new partner to never leave their house again because they carry a very common virus? Hell no...     I quote this post all the time so let's end on this.   Nobody should ever fail to pursue a promising sexual relationship for fear of HPV.  The virus isn't that important, and people should not let a normal consequence of human sexuality interfere with sexual or romantic fulfillment.     ","{'labels': ['curiosity', 'optimism'], 'scores': [0.7182481288909912, 0.9128091335296631]}"
Awkward questions about rimming,"Hey all, the other night, I rimmed someone for the first time. It was a bit of a spur of the moment decision, but I spoke with this guy pretty candidly about our lifestyles, our routine STI screens, I asked if he showered, etc. and ultimately went for it. While I had been drinking a little earlier, I felt completely sober, I was completely conscious, in my mind, and fully capable of understanding what I was doing and was by no means a mess or coerced or anything like that. Obviously it's pretty easy to tell if someone hasn't showered in that area, and it definitely looked and seemed like he did.  Where I have questions is honestly about the health risks and if the way its done impacts it at all. To be awkwardly candid, I didn't go deep at all. It was all just surface level stuff so really wasn't any tongue punching sorry I don't know how to say it less awkwardly at all. Does the risk of health concerns rise if you do go deeper? And secondly, on the health risk front - I was informed enough to know there were some risks, like anything, before doing it, but I have to be honest I didn't know that much until later when I googled and got a little nervous. I do believe I am vaccinated against Hepatitis A checked my records and have all the super critical vaccines like Hep A, HPV, Meningitis, etc. and generally take care of my sexual health too and my conversation with this guy seemed to indicate he cares about his sexual wellness too. I know plenty of people partake in rimming and don't get sick, but of course I convince myself I will go to the ER or something. Now, I know no one can definitely say ""you're going to be sick"" or ""there's zero chance anything will happen to you,"" but i'd love to just get outside opinions on whether or not my anxiety is warranted. Either way, I've learned my lesson and will be more judicious with what I decide to do in the future and feel free to drop the ""anecdotal but i've done it 100s of times and I'm fine"" stories, if you have them.  edit also just want to say how appreciative I am at how non judgmental everyone seems to be both on this post and in general on this sub, appreciate you folks!","{'labels': ['curiosity', 'realization'], 'scores': [0.4129701852798462, 0.7020960450172424]}"

How can i stop this anxiety ,"Hi, ive posted here before.. i have been to various therapists and also experts in sexual transmitted diseases but i cant seem to feel any better.

The guilt and disgust is killing me. I feel like a whore even tho I shouldnt. I feel like I was so stupid for having sex. So many girls my age only had sex with 1-2 people.. while I decided to have 2 one night stands after my first partner. I feel so gross and stupid, and that other women are so much smarter than me.

Help pls! Wart? Std? Dermatitis? Yeast infection??? Idk,"Help pls!   This is an on going problem. In October I had one new partner, however he has many partners. I also started getting issues around that time as well. It started with just itching. Very minor. A couple itches during the day. It stayed that way for months. Then at the end of January I noticed excessive watery thin discharge. It hasnt had a smell or any discoloration. It leaves me feeling soaked constantly and made my itching worse. I noticed this patch of bumps at that time as well. I tried an OTC yeast treatment, I did 11 days. The discharge seems to have slowed down but the itch and patch of weird bumps are still therethe itch isnt as bad now that its drier down there, it itches maybe few times a day. As well as immediately after the treatment i noticed this bump appeared on my labiaabout a week ago Its not itchy, painful or oozing. Also no pain with sex. No weird bleeding. No burning when I pee. No foul smells. My labia are a bit sensitive when toilet paper rubs them but not while I pee or anything. I have an appointment in about a week and a half to get fully tested and an exam but any advice till then is greatly appreciated!   Im wondering if it could be dermatitis? When the itching first started I also had a rash on my inner thighs appear at the same time. The water where I live is hard water. At the time of its appearance I had been laying in the bottom of the tub with my vagina under the stream to soften the hair for shaving but I would lay there for quite a while and it was comfortable so I started laying there pretty much daily. The water made the rest of my body insanely dry, itchy and flaky. When I would scratch my legs you could literally watch my skin powder off. I put lotion on daily and a bit of hydrocortisone on my thighs and the inner thigh rash went away but the labia itch never did. Thats when it progressed eventually to discharge. It doesnt explain this new bump though   Also I put a tiny bit of hydrocortisone on the areas of my labia that itch for about 3 days. It helped the itch. Didnt feel it once during then. I stopped for two days and it came back a tiny bit.     ","{'labels': ['curiosity', 'realization'], 'scores': [0.9842706322669983, 0.37142491340637207]}"

There's not a single moment where it doesn't cross my mind- and I keep looking up info online about it to soothe my mind but it kinda just makes it worse.  especially ever since I saw it could spread around - and I've been so anxious that I now have it in my mouth from my previous partner performing oral on me and then kissing me or me doing it on him after he'd been inside of me. and also he ""accidentally"" put it in my ass don't think it was accidental he said it was but he was a douche anyways besides the point and now I'm scared if I have hpv in my mouth and anus that could cause cell changes and cancers.  also when it comes to dating. I've been holding off on dating ever since I was told I had hpv but I feel so lonely honestly. however I've been on a few dates with this guy, but I kinda haven't reached out to him for a week and halfhowever he also hasn't reached out to me so oh well but idk - because im scared of telling him when it comes to that point, even though people say you don't have to I just don't feel like that's right idk tho also because im scared its gonna spread around in my own body .   and also I was vaccinated back when I was like 13 - but im so confused about that as well - does it just help it to not develop any further, and then I read somewhere that it keeps you from spreading it to someone else but that also makes no sense,   and then I read somewhere that you can have chronic hpv usually the high risk strains does chronic mean that its forever? or what.   ugh also I've struggled with health anxiety since I was like 11, so no wonder my mind is all over the place - I just feel exhausted and sad and irritated that this is controlling my life in a few ways.  anyways I just hope someone may help shed some light on a few of my questions because I feel like my doctor just keeps telling me don't worry about it, and saying it takes a long time to develop in to something worse. but that doesn't mean that I won't worry all the f time","{'labels': ['fear', 'nervousness'], 'scores': [0.979850709438324, 0.3937858045101166]}"

Need some hope dealing with HPV ,"Hi, I F have had genital warts for approximately 8-9 months now.

Will we keep passing hpv back to each other?,"Hi everyone, I had my first Pap smear last year a couple of months before my 25th birthday. It came back abnormal so had to go for a colposcopy where they took a biopsy, it showed only cin1 abnormalities so they didnt recommend treatment but instead told me to come back in a year for another colposcopy which will be in October.  I did actually have all three of my hpv vaccines the four strain one between ages 16-17 all before I became sexually active in any form. I know that I got this from my boyfriend of 6 years as I have only ever been with him. He did have a bout of warts during our relationship which he had frozen off, Ive never had any warts, but he obviously had another higher risk strain as well which I have caught. Im not overly upset as I understand it is something that can be out of peoples control.  Im quite healthy but have been more health focused since I found out as I dont want it to progress and Id quite like to fight it off. Ive been trying to eat healthy, exercising and getting enough sleep etc. I dont smoke / vape or drink heavily. I also recently changed bc from the pill to iud as I read somewhere that the iud insertion can trigger some sort of immune response in the cervix or something Id also been on the pill for over 6 years and wanted to try something different due to lower libido etc  I guess I just want to ask, if I continue to have unprotected sex with my boyfriend will this delay / prevent me from clearing the infection? Condoms arent ideal for us but its something to discuss if it does make a difference  Thanks in advance!","{'labels': ['curiosity', 'gratitude'], 'scores': [0.864416241645813, 0.6604874730110168]}"
Recurrence After 6 Months Feeling Pretty Down,"I 22M first had a GW appear about eight months ago.

Two months later, I had a recurrence which I also removed. We've had a very active sex life since.

Help me with next steps please. So confused,I've been with my wife for several years now. We've always engaged in unprotected sex when she was on the pill and recently we are trying to conceive.  Issue - I've discovered 3 spots/warts. I'm at a loss. Neither has been unfaithful so that's not my issue. How after all these years they've now appeared is beyond me. I think theyre genital warts anyway but I'll have to go see a doc. Someone on another thread suggested they were.It's weird because they look like actual daggers rather than rounded. Neither of us has had the hpv vaccine as we're both old and the rollout started after we were in school.  I'm so confused at what to do next. I have them now but we've already been having sex all these years. I can't afford to wait for them to clear before having sex as we're both desperate for a baby. What am I supposed to do?  Is treatment more of a visual cure? Ie is there any point beyond just not seeing them? Can I just leave them seeing as they're not causing any issue?  Can we and should we just continue having sex if trying to conceive?  I don't know who originally had it but that's irrelevant really... Can I assume if it was originally me then she already has it as well by now?  The worst part is that they're under the foreskin so hard to see unless you roll it back. I already have sensitive skin and a tight foreskin so the idea of putting creams that will burn skin any kind of treatment is scaring the hell out of me. I can't even tape anything to that area as its in such an awkward place. Which is why I'd rather just leave it if there's no harm  Also.. I'm very much a pubic hair groomer. Never shave but trim using a foil head trimmer which is very close to the skin. Am I still OK to do that?

LEEP margin still being positive is making me so depressed - want to hear your stories,"Update I had my two week post LEEP follow up today and my doctor said even though one of the samples showed positive margins, he had cauterized all the cells that were unusual, so yes while the sample is positive it doesnt mean he left high grade cells on the cervix - he cauterized them instead of cutting them out for negative margins. He believes the procedure was curative regardless of the results and is optimistic that at the six month pap itll show a cleared result. Fingers crossed thank you to everyone who shared supportive comments here!   My LEEP was on Feb 5 under general anesthesia and it went smoothly with some cramping and pain, but after that it was just discharge for a while that has now almost fully stopped at 2 weeks. I feel almost back to 100 and was able to recover pretty quickly.   However, I got my results right now and there are two results     Sample 1 Posterior cervical LEEP which was HSIL with CIN2, where the endocervical and exocervical margins are negative for dysplasia! Thats great and i am happy    Sample 2 Anterior cervical LEEP which has HSIL with CIN2-3 with endocervical gland involvement where both endocervical and exocervical margins are positive for moderate to severe dysplasia   The second result is making me so depressed. While the LEEP wasnt too bad I am constantly under dread and fear over doing something even more invasive than that with a cold knife conization or a hysterectomy. I feel disappointed that the LEEP couldnt get it all, and I am guessing I will continue to test positive for HPV-16.   I really want to give up and not do any further treatment if the endocervical dysplasia because I am scared about the subsequent recovery.

Follow up on my HPV 16 tested negative and normal pap this time.,"Hi everyone. I, 33F, tested positive for HPV 16 in April of last year. It was mentally stressful to receive this news and deal with the colposcopy and LEEP procedures. While both procedures went well, the doctor advised me to come back in 6 months for a follow-up pap smear and HPV test.  Fast forward to now, last month I went for my follow-up pap smear, and I just received my results. It says my Pap smear is normal, and I tested negative for all HPV strands, including the high-risk ones. It's been a sense of relief mentally, so I'm content with my results.  Since my diagnosis last year, I made some lifestyle changes to help me cope. I cut off my previous sexual partners, one in particular that Ive been so active with, I ended up telling him about my diagnosis which led to us officially breaking up, which was for the best honestly. Afterwards I refrained from any type of sexual activity and decided to remain abstinent, as I didnt feel comfortable dating or even having sex. I also stopped drinking alcohol and smoked less than I used to.  Anyhow, I feel much better now, knowing I dont have this virus in me, but its definitely changed my perspective in choosing partners and being more careful with myself when it comes to sex. Perhaps this virus will present itself again in the future, but at least now I know to be more careful to protect myself and others. If this is something that you are dealing with currently, just know there is a silver lining at the end.

HPV-related questions and preventive measures for bad outcomes,"Long-story short, I M25 met my girlfriend F24 a few months ago.      Very early-on she disclosed to me that she had tested positive for low-risk HPV 6 and 54/55.     I thoroughly researched to make the most informed decision at the time. We ultimately decided that it's better to not have sex until her next PAP smear to see if the infection is cleared. Her gynecologist prescribed immunostimulants to help her in containing the infection.     In the meantime we started fooling around. This involved deep kisses and underwear make-out sessions. She has given me oral sex numerous times and I have stimulated her with fingers. My mouth hasn't really come into contact with her vagina, only through some layer of clothing. We have tried to be careful while also avoiding any form of penetrative sex. We have slept in the same bed several times.     She had her PAP smear done a few days ago and the infection is still there. She had a small outburst of genital warts which went away after a dermatologist burned them in the span of several procedures. Moreover, this time around the results from the test came back with HPV-16 in addition to the others.     Now this situation raised several burning questions      1 Based on the description above, how likely is it that she had transmitted any of the low-risk or high-risk strains to me?     2 Is is possible that she contracted the high-risk HPV from me. My last partner was a bit more than 2 years ago? On that note is it possible that this strain re-activated in her organism recently?     3 The dermatologist told her that after the genital warts have been burned away she can no longer transmit. A claim which most papers do not support. Her gynecologist also said that there's no cervical wound and that the health down there seems to be in-check. That being said, beside regular visits to a gynecologist, is there anything else we can do about it?      4 I haven't noticed any symptoms over the years but it is highly probable that some of my previous partners had given me some strains. Even though there is no clinically approved way of testing for men, I found out that some labs conduct biopsy tests. Is it worth it to get tested in such a manner to potentially detect active strains?     5 If I have HPV-16, what are the chances of it turning into a penile or oral cancer down the line? What can I do to mitigate the risk. The thoughts of carrying a potential cancer cell in an asymptomatic way is a tricky mental exercise.     6 If we are both infected, does it make sense to still get the vaccine. Would it still prevent cancer caused by these strains down the line even if one has already contracted them?     Thank you in advance for taking the time to read the post.

Possible herpes.. advice please!!,"so while out a few weeks ago I meet a new guy, didn't go home with him then BUT the following week we had talked and Friday night we hung out and hooked up and again Super Bowl Sunday..the connection with this guy was amazing. The way he looked at me when we are together, the way we connected.. something I thought I wouldn't find again.. anyways we have sex and just a couple days later I felt symptoms of a yeast infection coming on which is totally normal for me as I get them every so often went to urgent care to get meds.. but also felt like I had a cut... I told my friends he must have tore me because that's what it felt like, I couldn't see anything though when I tried to look.  I just figured because we did have sex for a while it caused irritation or the rubbing cut me somewhere.   This was last week tuesday.. 2-5 days after we hooked up.then I did notice what appeared to be an ulcer..now I'm panicking... this is a week after. so yesterday I call and get in to the doctor. I'm a wreck just bawling in the waiting room, in the exam room .. I already know what it will be.. they do a culture and blood work. I asked if I should say anything to the guy and she said wait to see what happens with results before. But I just fricken know it's gonna be positive. I wanted to wait to see IGG and IGM levels to see if it is a new onset so I could narrow it down.. anyways I really like this guy and don't know how to talk about it.. he's gonna probably run the other way but I feel like 100 he gave me it..he invited me out yesterday so I went and met up.. we did stay together not sex I lightly brushed on the topic.. when we first slept together I asked he was clean.... I told him I'm having issues and there will be no sex.. I said I had been crying all day and I was thinking of going to the dr.. I didn't tell him I already went.. he said he swears he's clean he gets bloodwork done regularly at the VA... which I think is just maybe for the physical and I don't think that includes std panel ... i wasn't accusatory or anything either I was being so kind I said you can tell me the truth I won't be mad and I won't tell anyone. But he insists he doesn't...yet today he hasn't checked to see if I feel better or if I went to dr which I find weird...   Anyways labs come back... they didn't have the IGM because for some reason they forgot to order that one so now they didshould have it tomorrow. BUT I'm negative for IGG meaning if it's positive for IGM which I feel like it will be... it's more than likely him. Do I say something? Do I try to date him still?

Are these genital warts?,"Hi guys, I was freaking out when I found these bumps on my frenulum last December. I read a lot about warts and it says they usually go away on their own but it can take a long time. I finally decided to go to the doctor today and she told me that they arent genital warts because they are look too bright and dont have the characteristic cauliflower look, I also told her I got the 2 hpv vaccine doses around 10 years ago after I got a plantar wart, so she said thats another reason why these arent gw. She said that to her it just looks like Fordyce spots or Tyson glands. However, I expressed how worried I am about this and she said she can prescribe a topic medication for it if that makes me feel more comfortable. Should I use the cream?

How fast does cin develop from infectio,"Hi, last year I lost my virginity In about september and then 2 months later I went for and check up at the gynecologist because I thought I had a yeast infection and even though the pap was 2, she did a colposcopy and said I had a cervical erosion and it would be best to remove it. I did the surgery  1 month later and the biopsy results from the tissue came back and it was cin 1. I couldn't have possibly got hpv before that. And since I received the hpv vaccine before the biopsy came back I can't take the hpv test to see what strain I have, or if the biopsy was right.

HPV-56 and Im feeling overwhelmed,"I recently got labs back that said I tested positive for hpv-56 October 2023.

This Dr made it sound like this was just so they could get a better look to double-check, but Im not sure how common it is for people to get an Anoscopy after their rectal exam. Is this common? Assuming theres nothing of concern after my Anoscopy, what is best practice for how often to get future anoscopies done?  Also, even though I have received my vaccines for HPV, it sounds like it doesnt cover this strain of HPV at all. If thats true, would you stop having sex with people?

Is this statistic and time frame the same for all strains or is a high-risk strain like 56 different?  Thank you so much for any help and information you can shed on this.

"Confusing HPV story so far male, genital 1 LR, 2 HR","Got diagnosed 3 months back with genital 1 low-risk, and 2 high-risk strains, no other STDs detected. Didn't notice any symptoms except slight burning sensation. Then a month later some small bumps appeared in an isolated 1cm size area on penis shaft. Or they have been there before? I don't know anymore.  The first dermatologist I went to diagnosed it as HPV, and prescribed immiqumoid. I applied it for a month, and stupidly also put it in other areas where I thought I could be having warts. What it did in the end is gave me extreme balanitis and small ulcer which I had to treat separately. She also noted that I'm fine to have sex with a condom after the immiqumoid treatment is over.  The second dermatologist I went to a month later was much more experienced, and first helped me treat balanitis. Then she also noted that the ""warts"" I have are pearly penile papules, and not warts at all. I'm no longer sure if they are warts or not, and if it's worth going to a third dermatologist, although I still suspect they could be. She noted I can have sex as long as I wear a condom.  During this time I've also done 2 Gardasil-9 vaccine shots, and performed another testing of HPV but this time it was only a urethral swab which turned out to be negative. While I was delighted to receive the result, I'm not sure if I can trust it. I believe that in most likelihood I still have HPV, just not in urethra, is that a possibility?  Anyhow, while I was shocked to receive positive HPV results at first, I am no longer as worried about it given most people clear it on their own, and I believe the same will happen to me. The main annoyance is just the unknowns surrounding HPV, such as do I still have it, when will it go away, etc. As a result, even though overall it's a benign condition, it provides room for way more anxiety than what it's actually worth.","{'labels': ['confusion', 'curiosity', 'fear'], 'scores': [0.8279711008071899, 0.40061238408088684, 0.5043405294418335]}"

Prevaccination GW percentage in population - Way more than 1,"After talking to 3-4 doctors about genital warts I got the answer at ""it way more common than you think, just people don't ever talk about it"" -  ""Many women have cauterized something then and there"".  I tried to get some reliable data on that, but most countries don't keep track of these things. Then I found this aswer from Dr Handsfield, that summarises some really interesting data and comes from north EU countries that actually keep vast databases of diagnoses as well as an rough estimate from USA taken from NHANES. prevaccination  Question 4 years ago   HPV is unavoidable, and 80 of people have it, but isnt it something like 1 actually has warts?  Is it because 1 have a strain that causes warts?  To rephrase, is it true that a high percentage of people with an HPV strain that causes warts actually get them, or are many people WITH those strains that have always been asymptomatic?  Id feel much worse if the former and much better with the latter.   Dr Handsfield aswer  I'm not sure what you mean by your 1 figure. At any point in time, I suppose roughly 1 of people in their teens to mid thirties have GWs. It's also plausible that 1 of all gential or anal HPV infections result in warts. But very reliable data from Denmark and other Scandinavian countries, where amost all physiican visits and diagnoses go into a national database, various reports indicate that 20-30 of people are diagnosed at least once with GWs. In the US, questions of randomly selected persons in CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES, 15 acknolwedge having had GWs, and there are reasons to believe that many don't admit it or remember, and there is no reason to suspect the frequency would be any less than in Scandiavia. Hence my rough estimate of 25. If anything, I suspect this is an underestimate.   The Scandinavia data I cited are from 15-20 years ago, before HPV immunization. The same countries have high vaccination rates, and i suspect similar data today would show lower frequencies of GWs. But immunization is not nearly as widespread in the US, so for now I would continues to estimate 25 in our country USA.   In my country in EU the estimate is 5 of the population will have GW, but I have also seen 8 in some sites as a rough estimate -and these are diagnosed cases. Immunization may change that.  Also, a peer-reviewed study from Dernmark states that 17 of all women surveyed had a GW incident.","{'labels': ['confusion', 'curiosity'], 'scores': [0.9755369424819946, 0.4161408543586731]}"

STD Risks Post-herpes diagnosis,"I am a heterosexual man who was diagnosed with HSV-1 in my genital region a few weeks ago. I had my first outbreak about 10 days after she had hers, which makes me pretty sure she was the disease vector and I recently contracted it. I have always taken steps to protect myself from STDs and herpes and I still caught it.  As someone who enjoys casual sex and dating non-monogamously I'm worried this might be a death sentence, but given that I haven't been able to find useful numbers about rejection rate for straight guys anywhere online I think I'll just have to get out there and disclose and get a sense of how common/rare it is for women to consent to casual sex with a herpes-positive man.  But I have a separate question about my forward-looking STD risk. My mental model for STD risk as a straight man who engages in vaginal and oral sex has always been that if I use condoms, my only risks are herpes and HPV which I am vaccinated against. I still like to check in with partners about how recently they were tested for STDs, and I personally get checked at least every 3 months, but I still only consider myself ""at risk"" of gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphillis, etc when the condom comes off. I suppose I could still contract HSV-2 but I'm not super concerned about having bad symptoms and I imagine the venn diagram of women who would sleep with a guy with GHSV-1 but not a guy with GHSV-2 is vanishingly small.  I ask this because I'm a very sex-positive person who has hesitated to dip his toe into the more radically sex-positive spaces like swinging, sex parties, group sex, etc specifically due to a fear of herpes. But now it feels like I don't really have anything to lose as long as I keep up my testing protocol and wear a condom. What are your thoughts?  TLDR What are the risks of protected vaginal/unprotected oral sex with many partners as a hetero man who already has herpes?","{'labels': ['curiosity', 'neutral'], 'scores': [0.324960321187973, 0.8659176230430603]}"

How do I know as a man if I have HPV or not?,"Slightly NSFW, not sure if it fits the flair.   Anyways, I visited an escort about 7 months ago. And I got the following tests  By blood test Hep B, Hep C, HIV 1, and HIV 2   By urine test Gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Tricomonas vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticun, Herpes Simplex Virus 1, Herpes Simplex Virus 2, Treponema pallidum, Neisseria gonorrhoeae with mosaic penA gene, Chlamydia trachomatis LGV variant  And all of them came out negative. And no symptoms from then to now either.  Now, when I went to the escort, she fingered herself and then gave me a handjob, for PIV we used condoms.   And ever since, I have heard about HPVs, I am losing my sanity. I don't have the vaccine, and can't afford the vaccine cause it costs a fortune in my third world country.  And now, I have a GF/casual-ish relationship, and we were planning to get intimate with each other, she doesn't have the vaxx either, and is a virgin, I am not comfortable sharing my sexual history with her, with that said, I do not want to play Russian Roulette with her health. I am worried about throat cancer in the future too because of it, because it runs in the family.  What do I do? We were planning to go, excuse the crass english, raw with each other. Should I sleep with her? What do I do? Should I wait for 2 years and/or get vaxx? By that time I would probably lose her. But then again losing her is better than endangering the health of another human.

Anal Warts to Cancer ,Hello all. I am 31M. In November of 2019 I had about 5-7 anal warts removed. They used Cryo and then also prescribed me Aldara.

I am curious if anyone had information as to how useful anal pap smears are for men who have sex with men. Is this something I need to be looking into? Even if I haven't had any symptoms for over 4 years? How long before HPV can turn into precancer or cancer?   Any and all thoughts or experiences welcome. I'm trying to keep my health anxiety at bay.

Genital Warts - Success Story,"Hello everyone!   I have a success story to report. I have been suffering from genital warts since the beginning of 2021. I have undergone several methods and treatments with rather moderate success.   In January 2021, I noticed small raised areas on my anus during bowel movements. I didn't think anything of it and left them alone for a while. After a while, however, I noticed the spots more and more, so I had to take action.   The first step was to use tea tree oil and dab the undiluted tea tree oil onto the spots. As this treatment was external, it helped me well and after a few days the warts had disappeared. By this time I had already read up on the subject and knew that they were genital warts.   To be on the safe side, I visited a proctologist to make sure I didn't also have intra-anal genital warts. He then did a proctoscopy and discovered some inside. He took a sample and had it histologically examined.   It turned out to be HPV 11. Therefore a low-risk strand. He then prescribed me Aldara as an anal suppository. I used these for 8 weeks. I had regular check-ups with him. In June, during another proctoscopy, he told me that I was wart-free for the time being and that nothing was confluent anymore. This reassured me and I simply carried on with my life. At the beginning of September 2021, I felt increased burning and itching in my anus. I assumed that it might be hemorrhoids and used appropriate ointments. I also used these internally and again felt two raised areas in the rectum and thought they were genital warts again. I then went back to the proctologist and had another proctoscopy. This was in mid-October. He saw two wart-like protrusions and could not determine whether they were polyps or warts or possible scarring. He suggested that we wait and see. At the same time, he prescribed Aldara again as an anal suppository.   This time I used it with a few breaks in between until February 2022. These suppositories caused the worst side effects and also had a systemic effect with fever, fatigue and local inflammation in the anal canal. That's why I always took a break for a few days. Sometimes even a few weeks because I couldn't stand the side effects.   In March I had another check-up and the warts didn't get any bigger or smaller. They have not spread either. There were two warts, each about 1-2 cm in size.   My proctologist told me that as long as he couldn't remove them and examine them histologically, he couldn't tell me exactly what they were. What he does know, however, is that these things don't belong there and recommended an outpatient operation under general anesthetic. I struggled with myself and only went ahead with the operation in June.   Unfortunately, the warts were very deep in the anal canal, so only this operation could help. They were removed by incision and electrocautery. After the operation, I quickly felt better again. I also only had problems with bowel movements for 2-3 days. I was even able to go out again a week later and was able to work immediately afterwards. So it was more of a minor procedure.   The removed warts were sent back to the laboratory and histologically examined. It turned out that there were two genital warts and the HPV typing revealed HPV 11 and this time unfortunately also HPV 59 high risk.   My proctologist again recommended an Aldara course as a suppository. As a ""supportive measure"" after the surgical removal, so to speak.  So I used the Aldara again for eight weeks. And I saw my proctologist every three months for a follow-up check. Fortunately, I had no relapses and no new warts appeared.   In November 2023 almost 1.5 years after the operation, I unfortunately discovered these crappy things in my anal canal again during my own ""routine check-up"" at home with my finger.   In the meantime, I had read a lot of good things about myrtle extract. And I took AHCC and a combination of several medicinal mushrooms as a dietary supplement. I used the myrtle extract in the form of suppositories with a carrier oil.   I took 2 grams of AHCC and the mushroom extracts Reishi 340mg, Hericium 340mg, Chaga 340mg, Shiitake 340mg, Cordyceps 340mg, Maitake 340mg every day on an empty stomach.   I continued this regiment for 3 weeks.    What can I say? ALL WARTS DISAPPEARED IN A SHORT TIME OF ONLY 3 WEEKS!   My proctologist was surprised himself especially since a relapse after more than a year is unusual and this relapse could be treated so easily WITHOUT SURGERY AND WITHOUT ANOTHER ALDARA COURSE.   I didn't want to withhold this from you.   Unfortunately, there is not much information about myrtle and its effect against HPV and genital warts on the internet. I live in Germany and there are a few online pharmacies here that produce vaginal suppositories with myrtle extract.   I ordered these and used them alongside AHCC and the medicinal mushrooms.   And what can I say, from now on I have discovered a method that has no side effects, is not painful, is relatively affordable and simply works naturally.   However, it should be mentioned that I received the Gardasil 9 vaccine in December two weeks after I discovered the genital warts again.   My second and final vaccination is in February.   So I can't rule out whether the vaccination caused the immune boost. Since I have also used several natural remedies, I unfortunately cannot pinpoint success back to a concrete remedy.   Perhaps it was the result of all the procedures and agents used. Maybe it was the vaccination, maybe it was the AHCC or the medicinal mushrooms or maybe the myrtle. I'll never find out.   But let me tell you that even stubborn intraanal genital warts can be cured without surgery or chemicals.","{'labels': ['realization', 'neutral'], 'scores': [0.4075334668159485, 0.9253949522972107]}"

Tons of blood / discharge and light itching.  2 Weeks Post Op Things seem to be progressing well. Less blood and pain.  3 Weeks Post Op INTENSE itching / discharge with fishy odor.  Something's not right.  4 Weeks Post Op Can feel something now in the opening / lining of my anus. Becomes visible after a BM. Very uncomfortable and insane itching.  Blood is now increasing. Only relief is from a sitz bath.    December 26, 2023 - Post Op Appointment Surgeon diagnoses me with an early reoccurrence and very inflamed wart. Tests me for HIV. Comes back negative. BM's are very uncomfortable / painful. Second surgery scheduled.   January 3, 2024 Second procedure. This day was BAD. I'm now in a LOT of pain. Itching is so uncomfortable. If I didn't get the surgery that day I might have jumped off a building. Was screaming in the car ride.  Post procedure Not as painful as the first.

My HPV Story I hope it helps someone,A year ago I was diagnosed with high risk HPV. Since I didnt have any changes at the cellular level I was told Id have to wait a year and go back for a follow up. My doctor suggested I get vaccinated and told me to do my best to stay healthy and stress free. Yeah right. The waiting game felt never ending. At the same time I was diagnosed with HPV I was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypothyroidism. I literally felt like my world was crumbling. I took my doctors suggestion and went ahead and got vaccinated. I also started taking medication for my other conditions. I started eating better lost weight and waited for my yearly swab to come up. Well last week I went for the HPV retest and my gynecologist told me that she was going to stay positive but the reality was that with my underlying health conditions it would be difficult for my immune system to try and overcome the HPV and typically it can take 2 years or more. I was pretty bummed. She said that if I tested positive a second time I would need a colposcopy. Well today I got my results and ladies and gentlemen Im HPV NEGATIVE AND MY PAP WAS COMPLETELY NORMAL!!! My immune system totally kicked ass this time! Im so relieved. Ill still have to go back next year to make sure its completely out of my system. If anyone reading this has underlying conditions and feels like this battle is impossible I reassure you its definitely possible to heal from HPV in a year! Have faith in yourselves and in your bodies. I know that HPV could possibly lie dormant and come back but I also know that my body is capable of healing from it again. Also dont get caught up in the google searches. I went down that rabbit whole and almost convinced myself I was going to get cancer from this.,"{'labels': ['optimism', 'realization'], 'scores': [0.9872906804084778, 0.47415339946746826]}"
Extremely worried and confused after reading a lot of studies and articles. Support needed please,"I m, mid20s, with no symptoms was in a long-term relationshipf, mid20s, with no symptoms for years, we are currently not together but we meet time to time. Last time we had a sexual intercourse was 1 month ago, before that, we were occasionally having sexual intercources for a long time now. Her last Pap-smear and HPV-test were both negative on April 2023, already completely vaccinated with the quadrivalent variant at that time. In October she wanted to check a lab for HPV testing lab says they use hybridization method for HPV DNA testing, and results were type51 positive on both mouth region and vaginal region, after she sent the results to her doctor, they said 'there's nothing to worry about since your pap smear results were negative, you can have sex and continue live normally'. We have seen each other occasionally after that time again, last one was 1 month ago. Today i got my results from the same lab after 1.5 day and both of my results were negative mouth region and penile region. I've discussed these results with the lab and they said this is totally normal, and that i am negative with the correctness of 99.2 They have mentioned that the results for positive is around correctness of 85-92. Also I got vaccinated for HPV today with the 9-valent variant, and pretty confused about the talks around the cross-protective effect of the vaccine too.  Now what makes me confused most that how it's possible not to have the same strain after having a lot of sexual intercourse with the same person for a long time? What actually getting infected or being able to transmit a virus mean and does getting positive results mean that i'm not capable of infecting others, at least for now?  Some of the articles say that nothing is possible for a male to do or there are no test methods to detect HPV on males.  One of the articles say 'When the researchers tallied the final numbers of who had been newly infected with HPV, they found that the overall probability of transmission was 20 percent over a six-month period. The couples reported having sex four times a week, on average, and 50 percent said they never used condoms'.  Some of them mention that it's possible not to show any symptoms in 20 years. Does it mean i can infect others in an unknown time in a future?  And the most interesting one was about couples creating antibodies for some types of HPV.  Does this all mean both not spreading HPV or trying not to get infected with HPV is impossible?  Thank you in advance!","{'labels': ['confusion'], 'scores': [0.9578203558921814]}"

Advice on high-risk HPV disclosure going forward,"I 31M went on some dates with a woman, we had sex raw oral, condom penetration, I got a sore throat and massive lymph nodes a couple days later, so she told me she has high-risk HPV.

I'm just wondering what to do with myself going forward. She's not the one for me, unrelated to HPV, so I ended that. Yes, I need to actually take time to know and love myself but expect to be meeting more partners down the line. I think I'd like to disclose my possible infection, but half of the Internet says it's not necessary. I understand how common it is, and I probably already have had more HPV than I am aware of. But I'm bummed to know I'm a carrier and want to allow people to make their own choice about exposure if I can. However, it's daunting to feel I'm worth less than before, and to wonder how many people find this to be a deal breaker. Hoping some of y'all can chime in with your thoughts and opinions.

"Boyfriend came inside me both unvaccinated, do I have HPV now?  anxiety","My boyfriend M23 and I F23 had unprotected sex one time and he came inside me three times that day. I am on the pill but since I dont take it at the same time everyday, I took Plan B as well. We dont know if we have HPV because we have never gotten tested, but I have a normal pap smear result I took it a week before we had unprotected sex. We just got a basic std panel test beforehand cbc, urinalysis, hiv, hcv, hep b, syphilis and I also took a gram stain.   However, my boyfriend told me that his body count was actually around 20 and that he had unprotected sex with 5 women before me 4 were one night stands. Meanwhile I have had unprotected sex with 4 sexual partners including him, two are because I was rped and the other two are partners I dated exclusively. Because of this, I think despite the normal pap smear, I still have HPV.   Now I am worried if he passed HPV onto me just because it was our second time having sex the first was protected but the first time doing it unprotected and he came three times. I take Berocca multivitamins everyday and Ive never gotten a fever since 2020 so I assume my immune system is strong. What is the likelihood of him passing new strains of HPV onto me if ever he has? We both should have gotten vaccinated first but it was too late for me to know this information about HPV since we live in a thirld world ultra-religious country with literally no sex education. My ob-gyne even told me that I could still have sex even if I havent finished my vaccine shots, and mind you, she works at one of the best hospitals in my country.   By the way, I am also diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and now I am paranoid that I might have HPV cells that could turn into cancer anytime soon, or that I would grow warts inside my vagina. I am a graduating college student which means I am still financially unstable, and my parents are super religious to the degree that they slut-shame me, so I cannot even go to them for financial support. I cannot even tell them I got rped. Also my mom doesnt want to pay for my vaccine. I am also planning to go to law school but now I dont think I can, because law school is really stressful and I think it would make my immune system even weaker which could accelerate the progression of my probable and very likely HPV infection/s.

I recommend repeat pap with HPV in one year. I thought Ill be fine you know, oh my cervix will fight the infection.   But it didnt it got worse when I got another pap in July 2023 much worse to where I had to get an colposcopy in October 2023. So they did all that and seen I had CIN2 lesions, and they were telling me they look precancerous stressful as fuck!!!   On this past tuesday I had the Leep procedure and I was stressing bad, it did hurt. So they prop you up as if youre getting a pap, the whole shabang. Very similar to the colscopy. They were trying to numb my cervix they gave me 4 numbing shots but I still felt them slicing out part of Pfizer my cervix. And the machine they use is pretty nosey so I kept one of my headphones in with some music playing to calm my nerves. So as their chipping away at your cervix It felt like when your shaving your legs but you accidentally cut your self and than soap or lotion stings that cut.   The pain last for seconds, but depending on how many lesions you have and what size tool they use theres 4 from very tiny to large and the tip of the tool looks like an uppercase D  they may do this slicing multiple times for you. I feel like theres more of a mental pain with this whole process because it isnt 100 that the precancerous cells dont return. And if they do you have to have the Leep procedure done again and again.   Sucks because it prevents you from having a healthy pregnancy or children at all if they have to continue to chip at your cervix because of these lesions. Your cervix wouldnt be able to hold the baby in your uterus for long. So finger cross this is the only time for me and anyone else whos going through this.    Ill have a pap and if needed another colposcopy done in a few months. Im also getting the hpv vaccine one shot so far, theres 3 all together.

Had it cauterized at a random skin clinic.  From this point, I began changing my lifestyle, eating healthier, sleeping better, drinking more water, exercising more.  Yet at 22, I experienced 3 more warts develop in the same area. Left thigh. Also had that cauterized.   Then again at 23, several appeared. After some google searches, I found a random OB in my area to help me treat it. She ended up only having a chemical solution as a removal option which I decided to try out... sadly it left terrible scarring.  At 24, I'm now an avid runner/triathlete training 6x a day, twice a day. You can imagine how challenging it is to not have inner thighs that are constantly sweaty  rubbing against one another. A wart appeared one day on my left thigh which I ignored for months because I knew if I got it removed I'd have to avoid sweating  friction for a few days and miss training.   Another reason I put off treating it is because I grew to become very conscious of my chemical scars and didn't want anymore possible scarring.  Eventually, because I put it off for so long, it spread and caused more warts on my left thigh. I ignored them still until I started noticing two tiny little dots on my right thigh. Last thing I wanted was for it to spread on both thighs.   Today I got them removed. 9 warts total. Honestly these things can be so embarrassing, but I just wanted to share my story to let you know I'm struggling with it too just like you  to encourage everyone who can get it treated right away to just do it.","{'labels': ['fear', 'nervousness'], 'scores': [0.9034179449081421, 0.3756864070892334]}"

HPV diagnosis - Feeling Confused and Just Alone,"F30 - I was recently diagnosed with HPV non 16/18 late last year 2023, which came as a complete shock to me. Since Ive been celibate since early 2022 and I had been vaccinated as a teen.   I grew up fairly religious, so my parents version of sex education was abstinence only - so I feel like I never really understood the differences between STIs, how they manifest, how theyre treated, how we test for them, etc. candidly just relied on the common place - were wearing protection until were serious and we both have to get tested before we stop wearing protection. I thought I was being so safe. I didnt even realize there was an STI out there that men couldnt even get tested for.  Ive only had unprotected sex with 3 partners - all long term relationships. We followed the testing protocol before we stopped using protection and I still got it.   I luckily havent experienced or noticed any GWs yet, and my doctor seems confident that Ill likely get the virus out of my system. But Im scared.   Is it likely a 30 year old will kick it? What should I do to help my body? If my last partner was years ago, shouldnt it have left by now? Should I contact my last partner to tell them? Am I likely to all of a sudden start getting GW out of nowhere? How do I navigate telling a potential new partner?  Should I wait to date until Ive hopefully passed it?   Im all questions. No answers. Sorry for the emotional dump. I just wanna talk to others who might understand.","{'labels': ['confusion', 'curiosity', 'fear'], 'scores': [0.6635205149650574, 0.38026899099349976, 0.9515026211738586]}"
Your experience in clearing HPV,M34 Ive been dealing with HPV genital warts since April 2023. I was infected in March 2023 and started to develop symptoms in April. I first notice a group of warts about 5 developing near the head of my penis on the underside. I also noticed a single wart develop mid shaft also on the underside. I visited multiple doctors and only about two confirmed it was HPV the rest just brushed it off. I had the single wart treated in October 2023 with TCA Acid. I kind of wished I hadnt because now Im left with a pink scar and I am not sure if itll completely fade away. It is now February 2024 and I am still dealing with this. I noticed that I have developed a few more warts and Im worried about if this will ever stop. They say most people 9 out of 10 clear the virus within two years. It has been less than that time 10 months but I need some peace of mind. I am interested in hearing personal experiences of people clearing the virus and remaining wart free. I am also interested in hearing experiences of the warts clearing on their own without treatment.,"{'labels': ['fear'], 'scores': [0.5814409852027893]}"

My boyfriend has an aversion to me because I got infected with HPV and have condylomas,"Some time ago I was infected with HPV from my ex boyfriend and with decreasing immunity and increasing stress during the last three months a few condylomas appeared on my labia. For over a month I have been trying to solve it, first it was an abrasion in the gynecological clinic and then a burn with nitrogen and I still have some but I am trying to solve this whole inconvenience. I decided to tell about it all to my partner, I wanted to inform him about what the problem is and what the potential consequences are, just to make sure that he doesn't have it either, or that he can possibly be treated and that it would be good to solve it, so that he should go to a urologist or venereologist.       The whole problem is that he finds it revolting and disgusting. He doesn't treat me nice like he used to and it makes me feel unattractive. So, there's also an attraction problem and he's averse to any more cuddling or possibly having sex with protection. Overall I feel like I've become quite estranged because of it. I have to note that 3 months ago I was still being treated with antibiotics for mycoplasmas and ureoplasmas, he knows about it and I also gave him antibiotics.     Now, because of this, our relationship is a bit stagnant and there are a lot of unspoken things between us. Every time I try to talk about it, I just get a negative reaction or my partner doesn't want to talk about it at all.  I understand that he may feel hurt, but I would like to resolve this whole unpleasantness between the two of us, but I don't know how. Today he declared that my illnesses are the objective reason for what is currently happening between us.

Found out my crush has hpv,"This is my first experience encountering anyone with an std in my knowledge and I'm just confused and looking for other peoples perspectives.   I started talking to this girl and really like her, and last weekend we hung out. We ended up making out, she was giving me a handjob, and I was fingering her. I definetly touched my mouth with the same hand I was fingering her with. I got on top of her, but she stopped me and said before doing anything else that she has hpv and had genital warts but had all of them cleared, and if we do anything it has to be with a condom. I was pretty dumbfounded, going from being mesmerized by this woman to being afraid I just contracted a serious std. I told her I wanted to wait and I think I handled the rest of the night well.  I went to a walk-in clinic and told them the story, and they said there is a low chance of me getting it, and I couldn't get tested to see if I have it yet. I'm really not all that worried that I have it, but I'm still going in a few days to get tested for everything since I've never been tested before.  I just have no idea how to proceed with this girl. From what I've seen, hpv can go away in 2 years , and sometimes it can last forever. She said she got it from 2 ex's ago but didn't know and found out around last fall. So I don't know her timeline, and I also don't know how much knowledge she has of the situation, or if she's being completely honest. She's a human being and I don't want to just cast her out because of this, and I wonder if this is something she can be cured of and we can get past. But at the same time, I just met her and maybe I'm dodging a huge bullet by just forgetting about the situation entirely.   So yeah. Any opinions or facts about hpv would be much appreciated!","{'labels': ['fear'], 'scores': [0.42684075236320496]}"

ASCUS last year turned to LSIL,"I had my first pap smear at 25 while pregnant and my results came back as ASCUS and basically told to come back a year later. I had my pap smear again in October 2023 and this time it came back as LSIL. Anyways, my doctor told me i'd be scheduled for a colposcopy in 2 months because she said its not really urgent. She's reassured me she's just following the guideline since I'm over 25.  I also had switched my birth control from oral pills to Nexplanon arm implant the same day I got my pap.

A comprehensive review of treatment options for recalcitrant nongenital cutaneous warts,"Introduction  The treatment of recalcitrant nongenital cutaneous warts has always been challenging for dermatologists as they often recur and relapse. Multiple treatment options have been investigated to improve the outcome. This review provides an overview of the current treatment modalities and summarizes the efficacy and side effects of each treatment option for recalcitrant nongenital cutaneous warts.  Methods  A PubMed search was performed through July 2019 to include all English language reports investigating the treatment for recalcitrant nongenital cutaneous warts, regardless of design.  Results  A total of 144 studies were included in this review. The treatment options for recalcitrant nongenital cutaneous warts can be divided into three groups destructive treatment, immunotherapy, and cytotoxic agents. Although both destructive therapies and cytotoxic agents demonstrated high complete response rates, immunotherapy, which is a minimally invasive method, was superior in terms of the clearance of distant warts. Intralesional mumpsmeaslesrubella injections and purified protein derivatives currently demonstrate high efficacy with well-established clinical evidence.  Source    PDF file    Note Page no. 41 contains ""Table 1. Comparisons of studies using destructive therapies to treat recalcitrant cutaneous warts"" with many different treatments.

Seamen color and HPV Question?  Venting,"I masturbated recently first time in a while and noticed that my seamen had a slight yellow hue to it. Would HPV cause that or is there something else happening? Has anyone else experienced this?

I was prescribed Aldara after getting two rounds of cryo done a month apart and I have one week's supply left. I'm contemplating just finishing it off even though it wrecks my skin. As mentioned above, I've finished my first month of taking AHCC and thinking about ordering two more months to at least give it a shot, although I'm not convinced that it's helping. I'm supposed to take my 3rd round of the HPV vaccine in March. So far everything has been fine, but I see like two spots where I think I'm about to have/having a reoccurrence. Both on either side of my frenulum very very tiny white dots, 4 in total and I think I feel a small lump growing on my frenulum but could be damaged skin from the Aldara?. Noticed it after using it again after taking a few weeks off from it. All this to say this is kinda bumming me out because I was hoping that I was getting past this. I probably need to setup another round of cryo soon to get this taken care of.     Overall, I'm healthy. Don't smoke, rarely drink. Try to get in at least 2-3 miles of walking a day.

I had my last one 3 years ago and everything was normal. I've been with my husband for over a decade.  I got my results back and they were asc-us and HPV positive. I have had no symptoms.

I did end up getting 2 biopsies and a sample of the inside of my cervix, which was similar to a pap smear.   My doctor had me cough during each biopsy. She said it's a way to trick the brain and it honestly worked amazingly well and at that point the speculum was more uncomfortable than the biopsy. The cervix sample was a lot more painful and felt like bad cramps. Overall, it wasn't horrible. I didn't take any pain meds before hand so I'm sure if I had, it wouldn't have been so bad.   I just got my results in my patient portal and all samples were negative for malignancy.  I'm waiting for my doc to call and let me know what the next move is.

I 23M developed genital warts months ago, they disappeared I thought I was clear and around a month ago I had a reoccurrence, including anal warts I think it was before I didnt take enough care of the situation, I didnt use to take showers before bed and I used to touch my genital areas a lot. Anal warts were small, and very itchy.   Now anal warts are way more bigger and more.   I disclosed that with my girlfriend the girl Im dating. She understood and stopped having sex. But we already had protected sex 3 times.   I got a biopsy and I have HPV 6/11.  Questions  1. What would be a wise next step?   Probably getting both vaccinated.  2. What are the chances that she got the virus? We used condom.   3. Is there any test she can take where shows if she got the virus or not?

Warts around mouth? 28F Help needed!,"Im trying to figure out what the red bumps around my upper lip are. One is on the lip border and one right above. They showed up after waxing the upper lip area 2 weeks ago and wont go away. Theyre semi painful. I thought the waxing triggered a cold sore first but the look of it hasnt changed at all the past week.   Background info   - My bf found out he has genital warts around the end of december. I gave him oral before that, both not knowing that he had it because he hadnt shaved in a while.   - He very likely must have gotten this from me because he didnt have any sexual contact before me ever other than kissing. I did and do not have genital warts - to my knowledge!  - i am only protected against hpv 16 and 18 cervarix vaccine when I was 12. However, to make things more complicated, i have a suspicious lesion inside my vagina since september that ALSO wont go away. Im getting a pap smear this wednesday.

"Its been 2yrs and I still have HPV- Imiquimod didnt work, starting natural remedies","Im 23 F and I have GW. Im making this post because this virus took me by surprise and I thought about ending my life twice. Please dont do it. Trust me, I know how you feel.   The first bump appeared Nov 2021 and it was really small but very itchy. I showed it to my doctor and she said I cant see anything. Something Im sure youve heard before.  She gave me an acyclovir cream to apply to the area and I did a blood test for HSV-1  HSV-2. The results came back borderline almost positive. Soo she gave me antiviral medication. NOTHING CHANGED.  The bump was growing and I got more bumps as the time went by. Thats when I knew for certain I had GW. She gave me Imiquimod, I did my research and it made me hopeful. I completed the treatment and NOTHING CHANGED. That took a huge toll on my mental health, I felt absolutely disgusting. I considered Suicide.  The scariest part was seeing warts on my vaginal opening.   I finally went to a dermatologist instead and she just recommended me to another doctor to have it burnt off. That treatment was very very painful, to the point where Im scared to go back. Burning them off made me feel better but the virus is still in my body.  Its Jan 2024 and I had a crazy flare up that woke me from my sleep. It was burning and itching. The warts seemed to have come from no where but I believe the seedlings have been there the whole time.   I am going to see a different doctor tomorrow and I purchased A LOT of SUPPLEMENTS.  I will be using a few treatments. Im hoping the vaccine is available in my country but I highly doubt it.  I will be using oral supplements AHCC, Turkeys Tail, Zinc, NAC, Folic Acid, Vitamin B-50 complex, L Lysine and Green Tea Extract.

How Worried Should I Be?,"Hey, 30 M here.  So I met this girl who told me she has HPV. She explained that she used to have HPV genital warts in the past but is at least visually cleared now and checked with her doctor a couple months ago. I should have taken time to consider this more but I invited her to my place for fun. We ended up dry humping naked in my bed, helped each other masterbate, and cuddle naked. Aside from these, we did not have any penetrative sex or oral sex.  Anyways fast forward to next day, I learn that HPV can be passed on simply through skin to skin contact. So how ""likely"" is it that I could be infected with her strain of the HPV? I've done plenty of research today online about everything on HPV so I understand the basics for HPV such as it's a common STI, you can get vaccine, can remain dormant for extensive time, etc. Anyways am I over-stressing on this?

Diagnosed with both HPV and HSV-2 in the span of 3 days,"Throwaway account bc I need to rant and have no one to turn to.  I 24, F had my women wellness exam last week, which included a PAP smear. My doctor said visually everything seemed okay. About 4 days later a few bumps appeared near my vulva, I assumed it was a few ingrown hairs since I had just shaved with a new razor, and I get them often. This time, the bumps ""popped"" and turned into a huge open wound/skin lesion that made it incredibly painful to walk, stand, sit, wear pants, etc. After the second day of crying at work, I decided to get it looked at for infection. My OGBYN suspected herpes, I was shocked to hear this but she assured me HSV is very very common. She did the culture swab and sent it off. She gave me a doctors note for work and a prescription for valtrex to be safe and lidocaine gel for the pain.  The next day, I got the call about my smear results coming back with abnormal cells and positive for HPV. They scheduled a colposcopy for me in a month. As soon as I hung up the phone with the nurse I lost it and started sobbing. I did some research and realized HPV is incredibly common. I then found how cervical cancer risk is increased when someone has both HSV and HPV, I so deeply hoped I didn't have both. I checked my lab results online this morning and sure enough.. I am also positive for HSV-2. Now I am freaking out more, I can't stand having to wait a month to get my colposcopy because with both infections, smoking frequently, and drinking occasionally, I fear I am a high risk of cervical cancer.   I feel like a shell of a person. Thinking back to all the times I had reckless sex with people, was it really worth it? Probably not. I have a resentment for all the people I've been with that were sexually active with so many people they ""lost count."" I have a resentment to my mom for not vaccinating me and thinking the Gardasil shot wasn't worth it. Resentment for my state not teaching proper sex ed bible belt education, yee-haw.   I tried to confide in a friend, and she started talking about how bad this is to happen to me, told me when I tell my boyfriend of 3 years I just need to be apologetic??? LOL for what? This isn't my fault? and told me I need to ask him if he cheated on me. I do not think there is infidelity involved in the slightest, we are so very much in-love and I don't have that suspicion in the slightest. But I am scared to tell him, he is the first person I've ever felt this comfortable with sexually and in general. He's incredibly supportive of everything in my life, but that doesn't make it any easier to tell him this news.

First thing, my boyfriend read the statistics w me yesterday, and 1 of 60 men w hpv 16 get cancer in the throat, and 1 in 141 women get it. Its a very low chance.  Many People who got the vaccine before sexual debut still got 16/18, so nothing is guaranteed. You can have had sex w 1 person and still get it. Its not about being a slut or whatever.  MOST HPV infections, even 16/18 clear out from the throat and cervix in about 2 years. The years increase with age.   During the study, 23 men had two or more positive oral HPV16 samples. Of these, 10 had HPV16 when the study began. In the group that had HPV16 at the start of the study, nine had infections that lasted a year or more. Additionally, the researchers found that eight of these infections lasted two years or more, and two lasted four years or more, the researchers found. In those who developed infections during the study, the team found that infections in men older than 45 all lasted one year or more. By contrast, just half the infections among men 31 to 44 years persisted for one year or longer. And none of the infections detected among men 18 to 31 years lasted for a year, according to the researchers. ""Our results show that some oral HPV16 infections persist in men for four years or more and that persistence seemed to increase with age,"" Pierce Campbell said.   Also remember, HPV 16 has been around for ages. The vaccine is relatively new. A lot of people have had this virus Hr and are fine. How did people survive the virus before the vaccine? Many people did.  Im sure most people who have been diagnosed with hpv 16 have also had oral sex without condom. The odds that it clears out from the throat are huge.   If youre under 30 or even 35, the odds are on your side. Oral hpv all strains tend to clear out faster in the mouth.

I also am unsure how protected I am based on the timing of my vaccines and the fact I haven't had a third one yet.  I'm trying to get a realistic idea of what the risk level would be. I know you can't test for it in men, which makes me more hesitant because I don't want to risk endangering someone else's sexual health by being irresponsible.  All the data I can find is vague, and it seems if I had it when I was younger I would be a lot more protected. Just wondering if anyone can give me some data or information based on my situation.

Feeling bad after HPV vaccination,"Hello. Last year I started a HPV vaccination program, for the first two doses I took the tetravalent Gardasil 4 vaccine, however it was discontinued on my country and for the last dose I took the nonavalent Gardasil 9 vaccine on day 6th of this month  Everything went good with the first two doses, but after the last dose I immediately felt like fainting and had to rest at the doctor's office for 20 minutes. Then it was all fine for the following days until suddenly I go a very strong lower back pain that didn't resolves with analgesics nor resting, now I don't feel the pain but I have been feeling weak and dizzy for the last week and is starting to worry me. I have never felt like that before and no vaccine had the effect I experienced with the last HPV dose.  I also didn't research this vaccine before taking it and just found out it has a record of bad side effects and have heard many horror stories from people taking it, which it saddens me since I was the one who got myself into this wanting to be ""healthier"". I am 25 year old, male and probably shouldn't needed the vaccine. I am also underweight and don't know if that might be a factor, according to my doctor my blood pressure is also low. My height is 1.75 m and weight around 60 kilos.  Has anyone experienced the same symptoms after taking this vaccine? Did it got any better?

Getting so tired of this. 31m persistent genital warts for 3 years.,"So I'm 31, got genital warts when I was 28 from my girlfriend who eventually left me partly because of this.  I have tried absolutely EVERYTHING 10-12 rounds of cryo  Imiquimod, for 10 weeks at a time for 3 or 4 times, each time giving me severe skin reactions on my penis and testicles. It's scary.  Podophyllotoxin, which seems to work only on the head of my penis, but on the shaft it just causes sores and NEVER gets rid of the warts. I've tried this 5-6 times now.  Aciclovir - I know this is just an anti viral and doesn't help with getting rid of the warts, but it stops them spreading while trying to use other methods.  I tried inosine pranobex recently, 1G 3 times daily for 4 weeks in conjunction with podophyllotoxin which gave me some hope due to lots of positive testimonials, but still nothing. Last day was yesterday.   I got the first round of the vaccine a week ago today.  I'm now trying Catephen, which was given to me by my doctor from the sexual health clinic here in the UK. The active ingredients is epigallocatechingallate, an extract from green tea leaf, apparently more recently available here.  I'm a fit guy, I exercise pretty much daily, I go to the gym, I'm active, and I eat a good diet. I've always taken multi vitamins/minerals, have drunk 3 L of water a day since I was 16, I'm currently taking vitamins C, E and D and zinc on top of all that. I'm HEALTHY. I have no preexisting conditions.   In the beginning the warts spread absolutely everywhere. It was insane. Absolutely insane. My penis was peppered all over with warts. Nowadays there's always 10/12 little ones around, and when I get rid of one another is always appearing. There aren't as many as there were previously but that's because I've learned how to deal with them better.  I'm at the end of my damn rope. I cannot do this anymore man! I've spent my whole life building myself in the hopes that I can find love and have a family, and I'm FINALLY in a great place career wise and on a personal level, but this is the only thing holding me back.

Internal vaginal itching,"Hi! I really need to vent about this, Im really worry and sad. For 2/3 weeks I have this internal vagina itching and also at the beginning of the vaginal opening, without other symptoms or discharge. I think it is due to the fact that I had sex almost every day, for about 1 week, with a man I have known for a few months and we already had 1/2 other sexual encounters before spending our ""week"" together I lost my virginity two years ago, but I had never had complete a intercouse  and  I think that this irritation  is due to the rubbing of the condom it happened a few times that it hurt when he entered, I think because I wasn't wet enough and by the fact that I used sex toys in those days  in the last 2/3 days that we were together, I had my period and I made a mistake in buying pads, so unfortunately I only had to change the pad once per day in those days I noticed that when I peed it smelled like someone take a shit, usually it only happened if I held in my pee for a while or not drank enough water, and its something that never happened to me. When I got home and my period ended, I started to have some sort of itching/discomfort at the entrance to the vagina and inside it so I went to the pharmacy and they gave me lactic ferments and some vaginal suppository, because, according to the pharmacists it was the beginning of a yeastinfection after 3/4 it seemed to be going better, but I had my first gynecological visit  I masturbated internally and then I noticed my symptoms got worse because my urethra also started to burn every time I took the last drop of pee the gynecologist prescribed me more powerful lactic ferments to take for 3 months, but my internal itching is not going away even though I started this new treatment it has heal a little compared to when I had not started any treatment so I am I went to the pharmacy again and they gave me a cream with lactic ferments and a cranberry medicine to protect me from a urinary tract infection, the strange smell of pee disappeared last week and the burning while pee since yesterday. Today I went to the doctor and she told me to get tested for HPV and vaginitis which is strange, because the hpv test in my country is rarely done before the age of 25 and I'm 20 I'm very worried that it could be hpv, even though I had the vaccine at 14 years old in 2014. I also have anal fissures since I was born, so I also get some bright red bleeding on my toilet paper sometimes, so I don't think they're related to this vaginal itching.

Ways to Prevent/Reduce Nine STDs,"Pharmacist here reading through STD posts seeing lots of unnecessary worry.  I just want to spread the word that you can prevent HIV, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Human Papilloma Virus HPV, and mpox formerly Monkeypox and reduce herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.  HIV is preventable by taking Truvada or Descovy one tablet by mouth daily.  In the United States, insurance will cover it.  If you don't have insurance, many government programs will supply it free.  Ask a doctor I'm worried about getting HIV, can I have HIV PreP?  A nice side effect it decreases the risk for HSV-2 herpes acquisition by 30 in heterosexual partners.  Speaking of herpes, the risk of getting HSV-2 can be minimized with the drug valacyclovir.  If your sexual partner has herpes, you can make sure he or she takes valacyclovir to reduce the chances that you will acquire it from him or her.  There are vaccines available to prevent HepA, HepB, HPV, and mpox.  Many children are vaccinated against HepB and HPV, but if you weren't, you can do it as an adult.  Engerix-B and Prehevbrio prevent HepB.  Vaqta prevents HepA.  Twinrix prevents both HepA and HepB.  Gardasil-9 prevents 9 types of HPV genital warts and cervical cancer.  JYNNEOS prevents mpox.  Most of these require two or three injections, months apart.   Lastly, in men who have sex with men but not in women or in men who have sex with women, transmission of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis can be reduced with doxycycline 200mg taken by mouth within 24 hours of unprotected sex. This usage is called ""DoxyPEP.""  You don't need to get tested and wait for results, worrying about testing windows and false negatives, and then get treated.  You can just take a single dose and be done with it.  None of this changes the best ways to stay STD-free abstinence, fewer partners, condom-use, and regular testing.

My journey with HPV and what WORKED ,"I'm a guy in my late 30s.  I was never vaccinated for HPV because I was always too old, until recently.  In addition I live in rural Alabama and it took me a while to find a good dermatologist who was willing to work with me out of the box.  About 2 years ago, I found a small bump in my pubic mound.  I thought it was a skin tag and mistakenly cut it off spreading the virus.   A month or so later, I had 10-20 small warts in my public area and base of my penis.  For the past year I had monthly visits to the dermatologist, treating them with everything from cryotherapy, to podofilox, Vitamin E, Acupuncture, Oral AHCC mushrooms, to candida antigen injections.  Nothing worked for more than a few weeks, when the warts would begin to reappear.  It was definitely affecting my mental health, and my enjoyment of life.  I am currently wart-free.  It's been about a month.  I can't be sure of relapses of course right now, but I'll post follow-ups to this thread either way.  I have never been wart-free for this long, and I can see a difference in my skin.  I am confident that I'm either clear, or clearing the virus.   I wanted to share what I have been doing recently which seems to have done the trick.  Note the links referenced in the text at the end of this post with brackets.  Vitamin B-12  - For an unrelated reason, I was tested for vitamins, and learned that I was very deficient in B-12.  I did some research and found that there is a high correlation between people with warts, and people who are B-12 deficient 1.  This may explain why my body wasn't clearing the virus well.  B-12 deficiency affects immune function.  So I started taking daily B-12 lozenges and B-12 shots every few weeks.  My levels are now in the high-normal range.  Reishi mushrooms - Supplement daily.  1/2 teaspoon dried mushroom fruiting bodies not mycelium.  You can buy it from Real Mushrooms. Good for general immune support. 2  Low dose isotretinoin  - My dermatologist has had good luck with it for warts, and prescribed 10mg Isotretenoin every other day 3.  Basically Accutane, used for acne, but at a much lower dose.  Generally he said that you should see effects within a month if it is going to work.  This is my experience.  Local Hyperthermia - This was my own addition after research.  There is good evidence for curing warts and some skin cancers with local heat applied to the areas 4.  The heat should be around 44 deg C, or 111 deg F.  This is hot enough to have a local affect, but not so hot as to burn the skin.  I got lucky and found the perfect device for this.  It's actually a heated massage-gun head for a Hyperice massage-gun 5, and when you use setting 2 out of 3 2 LEDs glowing, 1 LED dark, my laser thermometer shows it heats consistently to 116 degrees F.   3 LEDs glowing is about 130 deg F and TOO HOT.  You do NOT need the massage gun itself, just the head 35, which you can apply directly to the area.   The protocol in the white papers describes THREE days consecutive heating the area constantly for 30 minutes.  Then TWO days consecutive a week later.  Then ONE day each week until the areas resolve.  This is what I did.  If will feel very warm, but i should not burn or hurt.  Obviously if it does hurt, don't do it.  I used all three of these in combination, with the blessing of my dermatologist.  I also did one round of Podofilox to kickstart the process.  I waited until the lesions healed before starting the hyperthermia.  Two months later, even lesions that I did not use Podofilox on have cleared.  I also meditate regularly on health and healing not just HPV.   I focus on my heart beat in the area until the whole region starts pulsing, and imagine healing light and clear skin.  I think the directed mind can have a large impact on the immune system.   I do wonder if the candida injections would have worked if my B-12 levels were not deficient during that treatment time period.  There is good evidence for that therapy regimen for sure.  So that's it.  I would love to say this will work for everybody, but of course warts are very challenging and personal journey.    If this helps a few people accelerate their healing, and the added stress to their lives, that will make me happy.  Of course the local hyperthermia only works on external warts, like I had.  But do get your B-12 checked if possible, or just start taking B-12 as part of your daily routine.  Excess B-12 just gets eliminated through urine, so there really is no downside.  In addition of course eat well, exercise, get good sleep.  All the things to improve your immune function.   References  1   2   3   4   5     Good luck!

High Risk HPV finally cleared,"After two years, I have finally cleared High Risk HPV. I wanted to share my story, so I can bring some encouragement and hope to those of you who have been struggling through this diagnosis. 32f   It was such a difficult journey for me that was wrapped with so much grief, tremendous amount of anxiety, and shame. In early January 2022, I matched with a guy on Hinge and stupidly went over to his place and long story short, we hooked up and did not use protection. Honestly, it was the absolute worst. I was super uncomfortable but fell into the pressure of having sex with him. This was the second guy I had ever had sex with and I was freaking out so I ended up taking a plan b pill to be safe.   The following two days, I fell ill. I started to develop a sore throat with a fever and body aches that progressively got worse. I remember my cousin was visiting at the time and he convinced me that I had chlamydia or gonorrhea of the throat. I freaked the fuck out and went to urgent care. Apparently, I had strep throat and was prescribed some antibiotics. It wasnt until a week later that I started to develop symptoms of a yeast infection. But had never had one before so I freaked the fuck out again and thought I had an STI. After hours of google searching, I was convinced I was having a genital herpes outbreak though I did not develop open sores. Im telling yall I was loosing my mind and was spiraling. I ended up making an appointment with planned parenthood and was in tears explaining my situation. The doctor was so kind and explained to me that I surely was experiencing symptoms of a yeast infection. She swabbed me and indeed confirmed I had a really bad one. Also did an STI screening that later all came back negative.   The months following were absolutely awful. I continued to experience intense burning and redness around my vaginal opening which kept leading me to believing I was experiencing symptoms of a yeast infection. I would frantically go back to the same urgent care and they would say that I didnt have yeast or abnormal discharge. And even did a culture test.. everything would come back normal. In July 2022, I ended up getting a Pap smear and tested for HPV. And that is when I learned I was positive for High Risk HPV. My world came crashing down and I felt so disgusting and dirty. I swear, I was in this deep dark place in my mind that I had never been in before.   Fast forwarding, I ended up getting new insurance so it took me a few months to follow up with my new gyno. Now this is in December 2022, I was recommended that I get a Colposcopy procedure done, which was traumatic. The whole experience was just awful if Im being plainly honest. After receiving my results, I had low grade cell changes and still positive for High Risk HPV 12-other. My gyno wasnt concerned and said that I had to do a routine Pap smear a year later.   Thankfully, I stopped experiencing the burning and redness after several months of being extremely uncomfortable. I think after I stop experiencing these symptoms, I was able to have somewhat of a peace of mind and not think about having a high risk strain of hpv. It had been quite mind fuck Ill tell ya that. I really was hopeful that my body would clear it and this would just be put in the past. Finally, January 2024 I scheduled an appointment for my routine Pap smear and everything came back normal! I honestly couldnt believe it! I will say that I really did ALOT of research and educated myself on HPV. I came across some amazing accounts on instagram of women whom had similar experiences that really brought me SO MUCH hope. cervicalwellness drdoniwilson   Thank you for reading my story!

How I cleared CIN2 and HPV on my own in 3 months!,"I found this page very helpful after my diagnosis and promised myself I would come back and share what I did if I was able to clear CIN 2 on my own. Please do not take this as medical advice. I am just hoping to inspire and reassure others who are in the wait and see period.  Last year, I received my first ever abnormal PAP smear and HPV diagnosis. My HPV was positive for E6/7 mRNA, but not HPV 16 or 18/45. Colposcopy with biopsy showed multiple CIN 2 lesions, including the ECC. LEEP was recommended, but I chose to give my body a few months to fight this on its own first. I read countless articles and research regarding spontaneous regression rates and what I could do to improve my odds.  Here is what I did  1. Stopped taking the birth control pill immediately. Some research suggests that hormonal contraception may make cervical cells more susceptible to HPV.   WHO links long term pill use to cervical cancer   Estro-progestin Contraceptives and Risk of Cervical Cancer A Debated Issue   2. Strict condom use, even with your significant other. Remember they likely have it too! Your body might be able to fight the infection off easier if it is not constantly re-exposed.

As many others have stated in this feed, I would of course also recommend eating right, sleeping well, and reducing stress. Ironically enough, this time period was filled with stress and lack of sleep for me personally due to other reasons, which makes me feel even more strongly about the things listed above!  After only 3 months, I had a repeat colposcopy, biopsy,  HPV test which was completely benign. I was shocked and incredibly grateful. Of course there is no way to know if any of the above things worked or if I got lucky. But personally, I feel that some of these things probably increased my odds of regression. I hope this helps someone feel more in control as they wait! Again, this is just one persons story. Please consult with your own physician for your case! And thank you to everyone else on here who helped me!  ","{'labels': ['optimism', 'neutral'], 'scores': [0.5823040008544922, 0.5302954912185669]}"

Looking for input on vaccine for 50yr,"    Last month I found ""two bumps"" on my vagina and immediately set up an appointment with my gyno.  One of my previous partners shared that he had HPV and despite using condoms, looks like he left me a lasting exposure to GW.    What was I thinking ?!?!?! To risk that exposure!!!!  Of course hindsight is 20/20.    My mindset was getting really mad at my Ex-husband tracing a blame game on him for our divorce, setting me out into the dating world.   Stupid, but I can't control my train of thought..point finger at someone other than me, silly.      My Dr removed the one ouch and sent it to lab.    BINGO!!!!   HPV was confirmed and I returned to have the 2nd one removed again ouch!!!    I have kept all of this to myself and have appt this week.  One thing I did do, after reading about it here is purchased some AHCC to boost my immunity.   I'm leaning toward getting the shot.   I would also be getting a Pap test.   But I've read that the HPV that causes GW is different that the one that causes uterine cancer.       Now this old gal is 53yrs old and obviously have not had Guardisil vaccine.  I'm told insurance won't cover it and it will be 200 for each shot.    In addition, I was told there really are not enough time/studies to tell if vaccine has proven results.  In addition, I have stopped dating.

My doctors appointment today was very difficult. I don't trust the doctor at all. Is he right?,"Trigger warning, I'm struggling intensely. This may be difficult to read for those also dealing with this issue.  Yes, I have read the FAQs.    I 37M had a hookup with a woman before Christmas. A fling with an old coworker. Two weeks later I felt two tiny little bumps right next to each other about a half inch above my penis in the public hair area. Right outside the protective line of the condom. I searched for the soonest dermatologist appointment in my city and booked it. I went today and talked to him.  I explained that I had previously had the occasional infected/irritated hair in my pubic region and that it looked like there were two small hairs coming out of these. I plucked them and they came right out with no effort, like an infected hair. Maybe that could be it? Could is be any of the things I read about coming up to my appointment? Ingrown hairs? Molluscum? a skin tag? Anything else?  ""Well it looks like a genital wart to me.""  So I asked him about information I read on this board prior to my appointment. Does it really clear in 6 months to 2 years? Does 6 months free mean I could be ""clear""?  ""I tell my patients to prepare to deal with this for the rest of their lives.""  I asked him ""Sooo... I'm fucked?""  ""Yes.""  Me ""My body can't clear these little hand warts, I've had them for 10 years. But I cleared plantar warts in a year and they never came back. Is that relevant?"" Him ""No.""  Me ""Can I spread to a partner if I get them removed and don't have any active lesions?"" Him ""No.""  Me ""Can I spread the current infection to other areas like my perineum or anal area? If I don't shave?"" Him ""No."" Me ""Can I trim?"" Him ""Only use scissors if you do.""  Me ""Could we do a biopsy? To be certain? Can we test for the strain?"" Him ""Yes but it will leave a very large scar. I will scoop out a large section of this area. And we would be doing this for you, not me. We don't really test for the strain.""  Me ""Can we debride it to be certain? Or would that cause it to spread?"" Him ""That might cause it to spread.""  Me ""What method of removal would cause the least scarring?"" Him ""They will all cause scarring.""  Me ""How do I identify new ones early if they pop up? Blacklight? Vinegar?"" Him ""Visually.""  Me ""If I have a partner would they be protected by Gardasil-9?"" Him ""No that protects from four different types of high risk HPV.""  Me ""But the Gardasil info says it protects against 90 of genital warts cases? I really messed up by not getting it."" He went on a small rant about it's ""mathematically impossible"" for a vaccine to protect against that many strains and that it would not have helped if I had gotten it. Also, that getting it now wouldn't do anything.  We continued to speak for briefly about what I learned on this board and he essentially said it was wrong and that few people are truly educated on the subject and the internet info was mostly people trying to cope. But some of the things he said along the way didn't add up, I did not get the impression he was credible on this subject, especially when he was discussing Gardasil. It left me desperately wanting a second opinion.  I left in a daze and have been struggling for the last eight hours. Two tiny little bumps are upending my entire life. I have no idea how to proceed.  Should I have them biopsied and accept the giant scar in my nether region?  Do I set up an appointment to get these frozen immediately?  Do I need to freeze these immediately before it spreads?  If I have it destroyed sooner, would that help the chances of it not returning?  Do I have time to get another opinion or wait a few weeks to see if something changes in the bumps? Miraculously it turns out to be something else? Or maybe leave it alone and see if it clears?  How do I find out what strain this is?  How much does this dermatologist actually know? I was in such a rush I didn't read the reviews, they're terrible! It seemed like he really couldn't wait to get away from my questions and get to another patient to make more money. He insisted we could only talk about a few subjects and no procedures could be done today because of the way insurance bills. He fled from the room as quickly as he could. He seems so non-credible when he talks and his bedside manner is so terrible, I don't trust him at all, but he's supposedly an expert.

By the time I was 19 my pap was clear for HPV, I was told that because I was young my body had gotten rid of it.   I started going to a different OBGYN. She obviously knew I had HPV in the past given she had access to my medical records and I'm pretty sure I'd mentioned it to her. She was also very casual and never really discussed more about it with me. She would even tell me sometimes that it wasn't time for a pap yet because at my age we can wait longer.   My last pap with this OBGYN was in 2019 and everything was normal as usual. Nov 2023, at 31 years old, I went in for a pap at a different clinic. This pap was abnormal and HPV positive which completely shocked me as I've been under the impression that it was ""gone"" for 10 years. I want to spread awareness that doctors have absolutely no way of telling if your HPV is gone or dormant. I was never told this information until now.   I had a colposcopy and they took 4 biopsies all which showed cin3. I had a cone biopsy surgery done two weeks later and a very small area had cancerous cells which were THANKFULLY removed but I still have to see an oncologist.   I'm here to say that even if you have been told you're ""clear"" of HPV and your body got rid of it, keep going for annual paps. I was too trusting. I waited 4 years in between paps because I thought I wasn't at risk for anything. I know that we're told that HPV takes decades to turn into cancer but I went from a normal pap in 2019 to cin3 with some cancerous cells in the length of 4 years. I'm a very healthy person, I don't have a compromised immune system or anything like that. It wasn't a reinfection because I've been with the same partner for 9 years no doubt of infidelity   Supposedly HPV doesn't cause cell changes while dormant and I would assume that my provider didn't see cell changes earlier and didn't tell me. So I've actually had HPV 16 for over 10 years, but it was dormant and somehow caused all of this within 4 years.   Don't trust a clear pap, don't become casual about it. Once you have high risk HPV, stay on your annual paps no matter what. It's better to be safe than sorry.  TLDR  I was told my body had gotten rid of HPV it was actually dormant for 10 years and caused CIN3 with some cancerous cells within 4 years. Get your paps annually.

My story This is long but I need advice and need to put this somewhere,"Hey guys. Putting this here to vent/commiserate and seek advice. Im a straight male in my early 30s.  Im beyond distraught as I write this and not really sure where to begin as this has been a major stressor and defining worry in my life and has led to depression, anxiety, and even alcoholism in my life.   Im convinced I got HPV in my teens from a non-penetrative encounter while still a virgin and still to this day havent been diagnosed despite me knowing something still isnt right.   At the time I went to multiple doctors and told them my concernsitching and subclinical small bumps I could see with a magnifying glass that previously werent there. They told me I was overthinking and had nothing to worry about despite me going back over the years with the same issues saying everything looks normal. At each of these visits I would also get tested for other STIs and was always negative. At the time, they also a said the vaccine was not for men.   There were periods where I took the doctors word for it, especially when the itching seemed to subside and I felt at ease with their diagnosis as I thought what did I know and Ill trust the professionals. I still avoided sex for years out of fear that the doctors were wrong and turned down a lot of opportunities with women and potentially great relationships.   Eventually I started getting these symptoms in my anal region and also started to feel bumps up there. I went to a proctologist and they said everything was fineeven did a colonoscopy and anal exam. At the time I also got an endoscopy as I said I was also having problems swallowing as well as some hoarseness. I was in a relationship at the time and my partner would go for regular paps which all came back negative. The itching was still there and would come and go.   Fast forward to today. Im currently single and have had 4 partners in recent years who have all been vaxxed.  I now believe the infection has spread to my mouth and throat. I have an appointment coming up with an ENT as Im having pain in my neck, hoarseness when talking , and a feeling that something is stuck in my throat.   I recently paid out of pocket for the first shot and am getting the second next month.   Im going back to the STI clinic next week as all of these symptoms have persisted and Im terrified I have cancer due to the longevity of this infection. Im also going to demand to see a dermatologist as well as some people have suggested on this sub.   I can confidently say this whole ordeal has basically ruined my life to date. Im wracked with fear, guilt, shame, and confusion over this all and still am not even diagnosed . Please help ","{'labels': ['fear', 'nervousness'], 'scores': [0.8679013848304749, 0.8772029876708984]}"
Genital warts / reoccurrence/clearance,"Hey everyone , Im m28 long story short had a one night stand and about a month later noticed some bumps 4 to be exact , long story short my doctor basically made it sound like my life was over but after coming to this forum searching around I went to my dermatologist he then burnt them off and said maybe theyll come back and maybe they wont. Im pretty healthy take ahcc not as frequent as I should but well enough for about 4 months and exercise . Its been about 5-6 months since I had them removed with no reoccurrence. So heres what Id like to ask get insight and maybe help others . What are the chances of reoccurring warts later down the road and what are the chances are full clearance of the virus? I know some say it clears and others dont . My worry now moving on with life is being that Ive had this and giving it to someone else , do you tell someone youve had it in the past? Ive heard of a lot of people clearing them and never speaking of them again. Long post but looking to clear up a lot of things for peace of mind .

GW dont go away! Why,"Hey all, I have been dealing with the same two warts for 2 months now and I am treating them with Podofilox. At first I treated them with salicylic acid prescribed and it peeled my skin and I bled and my skin went flat and it healed but like a few days later they came back, the skin had that textured of gw. Then I started Podofilox and they did the same, it peeled and bled it was so uncomfortable! And then the skin looked flat, white, but then a few days later it has like that wart like texture, a different texture from my actual skin. I apply every day twice and still see them there! I will make an appt to get Aldara as I have heard it works. Whats your experience? And tips? I am already also improving my health with vitamins and eating better.","{'labels': ['curiosity', 'optimism'], 'scores': [0.8110601902008057, 0.6720810532569885]}"
Personal Experience with Reactivation of Cervical HPV?,"History During my annual Pap smear in March 2020, I was diagnosed with HPV with abnormal cells I am vaccinated so this wasnt on my radar of concern at the time. A follow up colposcopy revealed I had CIN2 precancerous lesions. I had a LEEP immediately to remove them. At my recheck in Oct 2020, I tested negative for abnormal cells but still was positive for HPV. I thought I was on my way to clearing the virus. But in June 2021, I had another pap/colposcopy and was diagnosed with CIN3 precancerous lesions. I had another LEEP where 1/3 of my cervix was removed. My boyfriend who I strongly, strongly believe gave it to me and I broke up shortly after my procedure. I was tested once again in November 2021 and my HPV was no longer detectable. I was still negative for HPV at my annual Pap smear in January 2023. However, my doctor indicated that once the HPV virus is in your system, it can reactivate at any time, especially during times of stress or lowered immune system. Yet, I was under the impression recurrence is somewhat rare and may happen again once or twice in a lifetime.  Fast forward to January 2024. I just went in for my annual Pap smear. My mom is dying of a horrific neurodegenerative disease and I have been under extreme physical and emotional stress for almost 4 months. When I asked if reactivation of HPV was common, she said absolutely. She compared it to herpes and indicated I will likely go through an ebb and flow of positive and negative results for the rest of my life. I had no idea reactivation was so common and Im absolutely terrified as I wait for my results.   For those who have had HPV that required treatment with a LEEP or similar procedure, have you had regular reactivation of your HPV? I was just so shocked to hear my doctor say its common and that I will likely test positive over and over. I made the mistake of researching potential long term side effects of multiple LEEP treatments and Im spiraling. ","{'labels': ['fear'], 'scores': [0.969022274017334]}"

I have multiple HPV but my new gf just knows that I have hpv,"Hi all, I 29 M have a moral question.  Before going to the question I will explain a bit the situation. 3 months ago I confessed my feelings to this girl friend that I liked and I also told her at that moment that I have HPV, even though she didn't tell me that she likes me, she told me she doesn't know what she feels. In the end she decided to stay friends but stuff developed and she change her mind. Now since 2  months we have been dating and decided to be together. We still didn't have sex, we both in this period took the vaccine, she got the free one that protects against 16 and 18 but I also told her that I have the 35 high risk. So she knows that she is not covered for that. She also told me that she would like to do it and can't wait for the second dose of the vaccine that should be in 5 months.  Now here comes the problem, before I confessed to this girl, I had a check and they found the HPV 35, but my ex recently told me that they found 5 more hpv strains on her and I'm pretty sure that I also have them.   Should I tell my new gf that I have 5/6 HPV strains and not just one as she thinks? I'm asking my question not because I badly want to have sex, of course I would like, but mainly because I don't want to compromise our relationship. It is going very well and I'm worried that by telling her that it would intact this beautiful relationship that started between us.","{'labels': [], 'scores': []}"
Getting vaccine when already HR HPV  and had 2/3 shots in 2008 ????,"I cant find any medical literature on thishoping someone here knows? I got 2 of the 3 original Gardisil shots that came out in 2006 I think they only covered strains 16 and 18. I am kicking myself for not getting the last shot but I was a college freshman by the time i needed the 3rd and just didnt get around to it!  I am 32 now and HPV pos high risk but strain unknown over the last 2 papsLSIL last year with clean colposcopy and the very scary AGUS this year colpo and biopsy in a few days.  Can I get the vaccine series again since I didnt finish it earlier? I know it can be helpful if you are already HPV  and the newer vaccine protects against additional strains and I dont know which I have.  I am married, same partner for 11 years so I assume my pos status is either an old reactived virus or my malepartners dormant virus woke up and infected me obvs we cant test him, annoyingly!  I figure it cant hurt me to get the updated version of the vaccine but would I medically be allowed to get it?","{'labels': ['confusion', 'curiosity', 'fear'], 'scores': [0.41806140542030334, 0.5682324171066284, 0.7195909023284912]}"
